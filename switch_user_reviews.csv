0,4,"It looks soo good, funny stage & car names, cool music.  Lots of cars. However you probably will never drive them as the controls lag, oversensitive.  The cars handling can be best explained as ""its like steering a drunk sailor on a boat.""    You can swap to buttons only (like a Android/apple game ) or use the stick for steering. One brake button and one for drift. I kept playing the game for hours still hoping I get used to the oversensitive handling or at least a better car later ----nope.  What a waste, the game looks great and interesting, but is pretty much unplayable with the controls now.",barneygumble,"Feb 17, 2021",#DRIVE,Switch

2,8,"Great endless racers to waste hours, trying to beat your own high scores and maybe even reach a good spot on the leaderboards.My favourite thing is that it contains many cars that drove around on the streets here in the 80s, the time when I was a child, like the VW Golf model 1 which is the default car. Pity it doesn't have the licences to give the car models their proper names, but calling for example the default car ""Das Holzwagen"" (""the wood car"" in German, although with a grammatical error) is also nice.Sprinkled in are a few references to pop culture.Car nostalgics might find some value in this game, I enjoy it myself.",ophone,"Jan 23, 2023",#DRIVE,Switch
3,5,"69? 80? These are the scores y'all are giving it? Smh. Some of this game's music is literally just 1 measure repeated over and over for 1 level. The bar is set so low. Almost feels like reviews these days are rigged. For those of you without musical education, that means the music repeats every few seconds (depending on tempo.) The handling of the car is squirrelly, gameplay is repetitive. The in-game gameplay is repetitive but also the game meta strategy is repetitive, its just grinding levels over and over, like 25 times till you get enough to unlock the next level, rinse and repeat. As I said earlier the music is bad, and the main bonus to a zen game like this, is the music. The music isn't that bad. its just repetitive and gets really tedious to listen to. The voice acting is also devoid of emotion, similar to the music, very bland. One of the reasons I downloaded the game was the cool car personality in the trailer, yet the game has no personality. The graphics are very good so I will be generous and give this a 5 out of 10.",vegetarian,"Dec 13, 2021",#DRIVE,Switch

5,9,"#KillAllZombies is a third-person, twin-stick shooter, you’re the lone survivor of an apparent catastrophic event who’s faced with enjoyable task of holding off hordes of, you guessed it, zombies. The map in #KillAllZombies is hex-based, with enemies entering from different sides. Anyone familiar with classics like Smash TV and Robotron will feel right at home with the set-up. You’ll face everything from the typical zombie humans and dogs, all the way to gorillas and giant, bomb-carrying nightmares. To survive, you also need to be aware of falling containers, avoid flamethrowers that pop up out of the ground, and try not to fall into suddenly formed holes. You can, in fact, use these obstacles to kill entire groups of zombies. It’s oh-so satisfying watching them burn after blowing up the ambulance that was sitting right next to them. Controlling your character feels smooth and responsive. The aiming of your weapons, however, feels just a little off. Instead of feeling like I was aiming precisely where I wanted, it felt like the targeting was locked into certain directions. Kind of like the individual marks on a clock-face. (*Looks around* Everyone get that reference?) I quickly adjusted and it never detracted from my experience, or enjoyment, while playing the game. The game has three modes of play. You have your traditional Survival mode, where your sole objective is to stay alive for as long as possible. After a set number of waves have been successfully completed, a boss will show up, and they have some tricks of their own in store for you. Each boss has a weakness you must figure out in order to defeat them. They’re like gigantic, murderous, puzzles. The boss battles are a delightful change of pace from the mindless horde that I didn’t expect. Next, there’s a Vault Defence mode, where you have to defend a centrally located base. In this mode, there are turrets available to purchase that will quickly prove their worth in helping hold off the encroaching horde. There are also Perks (more on these, later) only available in Vault mode, that are designed specifically for the turrets. You earn money for turrets the same way you earn exp, by killing zombies and blowing **** up. It’s different enough from Survival mode to be fun in it’s own right and is a welcome inclusion. Finally, there’s a Co-Op mode, in which you can slaughter zombies with a friend. Both players share a single screen, and it works very well. I did manage to lose track of my character among the chaos, a few times. And that did lead to some unexpected deaths. One nice addition to the Co-op mode is the ability for players to revive each other. As long as the one acting as the EMT can survive long enough to stop and help their partner. I would have loved to see online co-op be included but I’m probably being too entitled if I’m expecting that. The game also includes some light-RPG elements in the way of experience points and character leveling. Earning experience is simply a matter of blowing things up, surviving waves and killing zombies. Those EXP points do lead to some interesting bonuses, thanks to the game’s Perk system. The Perk system is where you’ll find the tools you need to clear the relentless waves of zombies and, hopefully, survive the diabolical bosses. Every time your character levels up, you’re able to choose from one of four random perks. Some Perks, like invisibility and haste, are only temporary. While others, like extra ammunition and regenerating health, will stay active as long as you can stay alive. There are even a few perks that can end your game immediately, when chosen! There are a huge variety of Perks in the game. I was discovering new ones on a regular basis. Some of them, which I’ll never spoil, are downright devious and are almost too much fun while they last. The Perks are another one of the game’s major highlights. The 3D graphics engine in #KillAllZombies looks, and performs, well. It’s not going to blow you away but it’s also not going to stutter and drop frames when the action gets intense, either. I didn’t experience any technical issues during my play-through. The game’s music was one of the only problem areas, for me. While the rock & roll music used in the game fits perfectly, it became repetitive rather quickly. #KillAllZombies also keeps track of a staggering amount of in-game statistics. Everything from the type, and numbers, of enemies killed to the number of times you’ve chosen each perk, are tallied. The game even keeps track of how many times you view the statistics page! Genre standard Leaderboards are also present for all three modes of play. Both are probably expected to be included, but it’s still nice to see the developers cared enough to include them. It’s a welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch’s library.",ChrisUnseen,"Feb 13, 2019",#KILLALLZOMBIES,Switch

39,6,"There’s nothing wrong with a decent budget puzzle platformer, in fact there are plenty of them out there in the eShop. While I’ll give the specific style of play in 0 Degrees credit for not being quite like any of the rest I’ve played though, it’s in the execution that it feels a bit more lacking. The basics are pretty simple, with you needing to avoid spikes and sometimes activate certain spots in order to get to the exit. Where it is a bit more unique is that aside from just being able to push ice blocks around to help you avoid traps, activate buttons, and get yourself to higher platforms, you’re able to create them yourself as well, using the second joystick to aim. It’s the mechanics of this that tend to get aggravating and pull down the enjoyment level. It can be a bit quirky, for sure, and that’ll slow things down even when you know what you need to do. For a low price it isn’t a bad deal, just be sure you know what you’re in for. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/05/mini-reviews-may-25th-edition-nintendo.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",0 Degrees,Switch

If it ever becomes part of the bundle for the switch you can treat this review score as a 8. The mini games that make  1-2-Switch are a mixture of entertainment and annoyance. There is not really any way to pick out which ones you will like and will not, majority of people probably play the champagne bottle one, not have a clue what's supposed to happen and give up. You may also start to favour the ones that don't require you to take the joy-con straps off, or you may just take them off and leave them off. This is how much the games are hit and miss, but for a part, with 4 or more people you'll have a lot of fun for half an hour or more, and if that half an hour 35 (quid / dollars), then you probably got a good deal (Just remember how much you paid for your Switch first).",CrawlinUK,"Nov  2, 2017",1-2-Switch,Switch

The games themselves are fun at first, but lose their charm almost instantly after the second or third time.

Some people like it for being simple, easy to play, and relaxing, while others f*cking hate it due to the obscene price point and no replay value. I'm in the middle. The game is fine at what it does, but it gets old damn quick. Sure, the game has 28 different games, but most are completed in a minute or less, are so basic it's frustrating, and some mini games can be very bizarre.

It is a party game that really displays what the joycons can do. However despite the numerous mini games there isn't a whole lot of depth.  There isn't an option of keeping score.  Obviously no story mode.  It is a take what you see.  But really, after a few times playing it, you lose interest and fast.  Kids like it but again, just not a lot of options.",Oldskoolberk,"Feb  1, 2020",1-2-Switch,Switch
72,0,"Its insulting to call this a video game.  I know what this was going for, but honestly what this game aims to achieve as far as player interaction is much better found in actual board or party games sold at a fifth of the price.  The video interface almost feels like a hinderance to the games that you play, rather than its actual platform.  After playing this for hours I felt a longing to play much superior party/partner board games like Cranium.  This is a waste of money and a failed attempt at a party game.  If there is a video game to compare this to its the Wario Ware series which is 1,000x better and full of much much more thoughtful use of motion controls and actual video game content.

73,6,"1-2 Switch is a cheesy new party game that should be a pack-in title for the Switch. But Nintendo thought it was a good idea making this a separate game for 50 dollars. There are incredibly 28 mini games in 1-2 Switch. But to be honest, some of them are garbage. For example, Baby is something that you definitely can't play at a party. Shaving doesn't work like it is supposed to do. And Treasure Chest is impossible to play because the camera doesn't follow your Joy-Con. But other than that, it's a pretty fun game. Quick Draw is too simple but too fun. Milk is both fun to play and fun to watch. And Sneaky Dice is a real **** game where you can troll the other players.

The first few rounds were ok, we laugh, we smiled, the ""milk"" game is awkward, but hilarious... but for god sake, that's pretty much it. Even that ""milk"" game gets boring after 20 minutes. What a huge waste of ""MONEY"" and ""TIME"". It's not even a game worth to play in a party were your friends are drunk and all, the game is just not fun. I'm giving it a ""1 out of 10"" for the milk game and the first 30 minutes and that's pretty damn generous. Do yourself a favor and save your money for the upcoming titles. It should seriously have been a free game that comes in bundle with the console. And even that, I think I wouldn't be playing it.

Wii sports was a great way to show off Wii's motion controls and it's re-playability was incomparable with 1-2-Switch. It was something new,fresh and it could be played by everyone capable of holding wii remote. Sadly that can't be told about 1-2-Switch. 1-2-Switch is good addition to Switch's line-up and it will keep you or your family/kids occupied for a while but after that it will only gather the dust.

This is not really a game you should be buying if you just want to play it by yourself. However 1 2 switch was 1 of 5 launch titles on release for the Nintendo Switch. 1 2 switch does offer 28 mini games which is a reasonable amount and only really 1/4 are fun so this game won't really last long it's one of those games that you probably would play occasionally or play it for a couple of weeks and then completely forgettable. Although you can't deny that this game does use the Joy Con functionality pretty well with the likes of motion controls and HD Rumble. However it's not a console seller or one of those games you must pick up and the $49.99 price tag really doesn't help the cause at all 6/10",mikerbiker62,"Mar 24, 2017",1-2-Switch,Switch

Shuffle allows you to get a random game while playing and then there are 28 minigames at your disposalIn my opinion there are 5 awesome ones, 3 good ones, 10 forgettable ones and 10 more that are completely just stupid.The best of the bunch is Fake Draw and the worst is by far Baby that one is just creepy and weird. I would give a 6.5/10 to 1-2 Switch but I'll leave a 7/10 on the review",DeathStarU,"Mar  5, 2017",1-2-Switch,Switch

86,6,"Granted, I only played this game against my sister today, but I feel this game would fare better in a larger social setting with more friends. The quality of mini-games are a mixed bag, ranging from fun (safe-cracking, flag raising, yoga posing), to confusion (table tennis, plate spinning, baby cradling). The fun games manage fully utilize HD Rumble and showcase the full capabilities of the joycons (which are pretty impressive) and the confusion-inducing games are those that are just quite abstract to begin with. Unfortunately 1-2-Switch itself is expensive for a small party game that probably can entertain your guests for a few hours at most. However, I do thing there are still ways to spice up the gameplay when inviting friends over. Personally, I will probably pull out a jar of bad tasting jelly beans and forcing the losers to eat one after each round. That kind of external addition gives the game a competitive edge and will probably be very entertaining to watch. Can't say about the longevity of the game since I had not own it for very long, but I guess when the price drops it's not a bad game to pick up and play with friends.",ernchii,"Mar 12, 2017",1-2-Switch,Switch

Name me one time where milking a cow with your friend can be fun after the first or second time. Yes, the acting is crap. However, I see some redeeming qualities to it. For one, it seems that it was made for the younger demographic. I can see that this might be something that younger kids can enjoy. Secondly, since the Nintendo Switch is portable, it can be played at parties which can lead to a lot of fun. Whether you're drunk with your friends or just want to kill time at said party, this game can set you straight. Overall, I don't think it's the worst game of all time.

Most games felt like they were pushed for the release of the console and sacrificing quality, or some games were splatter paint as they seemed to get odd, which may be the point; but it was either not working well or not fun. In spite of this the Switch gave lemons, and the game made lemonade, they were able to produce (most) games with an original idea, whether it would be motion controls, using the sensor or the HD Rumble they could produce it.

To start with, it probably shouldn't have been a full priced release and would likely have been much better received as a bargain game, digital release, or (better still) a launch pack-in. As a collection of mini games of uneven quality, many of which lose their spark after the surprise and novelty wear off after a few plays, 1-2 Switch just can't justify its price tag. The game is intended to be a party game (it's multiplayer only), which it has the potential to excel at - if you have the right crowd. The unorthodox nature of the controls and reliance on in-game audio means it won't work for just anyone or in every situation.

This sets it apart from nearly every party game out there: it really isn't a video game at all. It's a game that you play with the switch.

There are 28 mini-games and some of them are really good, like the rotation game, fake draw and the boxing, table tennis etc. games. I highly recommend this if you hang out with non-gamers regularly and want something you can put on the switch that they will enjoy. I gave it a 10 because people are giving it bad reviews just because they got it into their head that they deserve it for free.

121,7,"I can see how the enjoyment of 1-2-Switch would depend largely on the kind of people you're friends with (and also on whether you have many friends, I guess); it's well-suited to people who don't take themselves too seriously. For our little group of eight testing it out on launch night, though, it happily kept us busy for a couple of hours. Some mini-games were definitely bigger favourites than others, but to my surprise there wasn't really any one in there that seemed like a dud. Stand-outs that I remember from our test run of the game: Copy Dance - perfect if you're happy to make an idiot of yourself by striking poses. We were.Runway - see above, but you also get to channel your inner Naomi Campbell. Or, if you've got less co-ordination, your inner wind-up tin soldier.Milk - It's weird. We played it a lot.Safe Crack, Ball Counting, Joy-con Rotation - All three of these were great at showcasing how far motion controls and rumble have come in ten years, they felt surprisingly precise and subtle. Joy-con Rotation had the interesting twist of having players take turns to lift and rotate their Joy-con as far as possible without wobbling it; taking turns meant you could see how well the other player did as you were accumulating scores (from each degree you turned, with three attempts each), and seeing the other player's score was psyching some of us out. Speaking of psych-outs...Samurai Training - The eye contact in this one gets kind of intense. It really is one where you've got to watch the other player, because you're paying attention to their movements and trying to catch their sword swings without falling for fake-outs.Sneaky Dice - Another good one for psyching each other out, where you know how much the other player has rolled on two dice (via rumble) but not how much you've rolled. One of my friends had a lot of fun messing with people by telling the complete truth with that hint of an inflection that made it seem like he was lying.Quick Draw, Telephone - Two enjoyable reflex-based games.Table Tennis - I haven't seen this one mentioned a lot, but I loved it. The ball is invisible, so it's almost like you're playing ""sound tennis"" instead, listening to the ball sounds to determine how quickly the ball is approaching you. More than most games, its enjoyment really hinges on what you're like as a person and how you socialise. If you don't really like party games or you don't like to be silly in front of others, deduct four points from my score. If you do like these things, it's not the greatest party title ever but it's light-hearted, silly fun and it could make a good games-night staple for you. Oh, and it's very camp.

125,9,"I am very tempted to give this game a 10 to counter all of the negative reviews from people who haven't even touched the game, but I know that a truthful review is worth more to the community. This game is not a masterpiece, it is not a must-have, and it is not a revolutionary piece of software.  However, it is an extremely fun game that is worth the purchase price to me.  I have several young children at home, and they enjoy softer Nintendo games like Mario Kart and Mario World; playing Fast RMX on the Switch is a bit beyond their play-level and even Snipperclips is a bit cumbersome for them at times.  Enter 1-2 Switch: the movements and interaction have been perfect for them!  They are easily able to comprehend and play almost all the games without help, and they're actually having fun together!  Every time we break the game out, it's a blast and we can spend hours getting lost in these bite-sized games. On the pro side of things, the game is very polished.  There are clear tutorials for each game and the environments/actors do a great job portraying what needs to be done while keeping things light.  The Joy Con responsiveness is incredible, quickly eclipsing what the Wiimote was ever capable of.  You can feel the marbles move around, you can feel the safe pins click, you can feel the milk draining from each pull, etc.  The focus on looking away from the screen is also another high point of the game, in which Nintendo forces us to look back at the roots of local co-op from ages past instead of just staring at the screen together. On the con side, the price is of course a bit steep for what's essentially a tech demo.  I wouldn't say that it should have been a pack-in like many others have, because that would have driven up the cost of the console for a game that so many are adamant about not playing, but something in the $30-40 range would have made more sense. I'm honestly trying to come up with other cons, but I can't think of any; the game delivers on what it promises.  Many negative reviews say that the game is mediocre, but then don't point out what makes it that way.  The mini-games are quick and easy to get into, as well as get out of and into the next one quickly. All in all, the game promotes good, goofy fun together.  Of course, this game is not for everyone - it takes a certain comfort level to milk an invisible cow or create your own dance moves - but don't let the negative reviews deter you if you think that you would have fun playing this with friends, family, coworkers, etc.  Some people just can't seem to understand that maybe this game isn't for them and that their preconceived notions aren't indicative of the actual game as a whole.",metanoia29,"Mar  8, 2017",1-2-Switch,Switch

133,4,1-2 Switch is one of the games that makes you scratch your head at the lack of depth of the games included. Included are 28 micro-games that you play once and get bored of every time you play them again. The other downfall of this game is the price.

The 3D rumble feature works amazingly well and you can feel them rolling around but it is not what I call fun.The game is trying to be like the old Wario Ware series but lacks all the charm and the fun of that series. While 'casual gamers' may get some enjoyment out of it the game is simply a tech demo at full price and I expected more from Nintendo. When you think of past launch titles like Wii Sports and even Nintendo Land, this one will be forgotten very quickly.

140,2,"1-2 Switch is one of the laziest party games of all time. Very little of this game stands up to the Nintendo Party games of past consoles. Past titles were essentially tech demos for Nintendo's newest system.  The developers of these games were forced to make a game to fit the gimmicks of the system, thus, the games were extremely unique at launch, and were always the best use of the system's more unusual mechanics. Wii Sports, at the time, was a very unique way to introduce motion controls to a more casual audience, and Nintendo Land was the only game on the Wii U to (in my opinion) utilize the motion controls, touchscreen, and second screen in a way that didn't feel messy or broken. Mobility and portability being the Switch's main features, I was excited to see how these aspects would be used in their newest party game. Even if the developers couldn't think of interesting ways to use the portability aspect of the Switch, I thought that taking advantage of the many different control styles of the Switch would be much easier than making a game to fit the obscure game pad functions. However, 1-2 Switch does not use any of the mechanics unique to the Switch, and instead focuses on the motion controls. This game might as well be for the Wii for all the difference the console makes. This would hardly be of complaint if the motion controls worked and the mini games were fun, but the motion controls almost always feel choppy and unresponsive, and the mini games are simplistic and repetitive. For example, the wizard mini game is the most confusing mini game ever created, and the quick draw game is remarkably imprecise. Without friends, this game is absolutely abysmal, and playing solo is the only thing that interests me in video games. There is so little happening on the TV screen that this game could be from three console generations ago, and there would be no difference in resolution or frame rate. Taking into account Nintendo's track record of simple party games, it's beyond clear than an inexperienced development team worked on this, and it was extremely rushed. I am very disappointed, and this is currently one of my least favorite games I've played this year. It also costs full price, so in no way is this game worth purchasing even to witness how much of a letdown it is. 1-2 Switch is a joke, and deserves nothing more than a 2 out of 10.",MannWithNoEyes,"Oct  7, 2017",1-2-Switch,Switch

153,6,"1-2 Switch is a fun game for a little while, and by a little while, I mean until you play every mini game once or twice. I think as a stand-alone game you will get some fun out of it with friends or family, however, in my opinion, if you add some other things to it, such as punishments for the losers or rewards for the winners, it is much more fun. The game comes with 28 mini games: Telephone, Ball Count, Zen, Treasure Chest, Milk, Safe Crack, Quick Draw, Samurai Training, Sneaky Dice, Signal Flags, Soda Shake, Shave, Joy-Con Rotation, Table Tennis, Baby, Fake Draw, Baseball, Eating Contest, Beach Flag, Wizard (My personal favorite), Sword Fight, Boxing Gym, Plate Spin, Copy Dance, Runway, Air Guitar, Dance Off, and Gorilla. I had hoped on release that there would be free DLC with more mini games, but there was no DLC at all. Another issue I have with the game is that it has no age range. Some games are more complex, such as Sneaky Dice, and then there are other ones like Milk, where you move your arm up and down. A positive of the game is that it is a great party starter. I invited some friends over and we played through each and every mini game with the loser having to eat one of the Bean Boozled jellybeans and it was great fun (Thank you for the idea AbdallahSmash026). But, after all of this, the biggest problem to me is that before every game, you sit through a 1-2 minute video on how to play, and then you play and it lasts about 20  seconds. Overall, if you have some extra money and want a party game, go ahead and buy it, but not for full retail price.

So yes, the title is pretty damn accurate! Yes, the game really is that simple, but it is also very tricky, everything is about speed, when the level starts you can look around, you will see the enemies that you need to kill, and work out a route, and as soon as you start moving, the timer starts to tick down, if you have not killed all enemies within 10 seconds, you lose. The faster you complete a level, the more stars you get, the aim being 3 stars, but you can pass the level with 1 star if under 10 seconds. There are 100 levels to beat, leader boards for each level, things to unlock and collect to add a bit more of a challenge too. The controls are super simple, you run back and forth, you can jump, and of course the now obligatory double jump, you can slash your enemies with a Katana sword, or you can hit them from afar with Shurikens, (Ninja Throwing Stars) you only get 3 of them per level, so you need to use them wisely to hit enemies you can't reach by jumping, or ones protected with an electrical shield. As you progress through the game, some enemies you come across will be immune to the Throwing Stars too, just when you thought you had it mastered, the game throws a spanner in the works. Some levels will have switches you need to activate, to move platforms, others will have surfaces you can bounce your ninja stars off, and even surfaces you can hold on to. The more stars you collect, the more levels you unlock. There are also costumes you can unlock for your ninja. And in the pre-level area, if you find the hidden CD pieces, you can unlock an extra minigame, so that is worth looking for. The GoodWith the short time limit, and the leader boards, there is a strong ""re-playability"" to the levels.

169,7,"This minimalist, and quite challenging, platformer will absolutely make you a bit crazy if your goal isn’t just to complete tough levels but also do so in an insanely limited amount of time. Sure, within a few attempts you’ll likely be able to tackle some of these tough precision stages but in order to truly conquer each level with the best time you’ll have to throw out any and all hesitation and execute every move to perfection. To its credit the controls are crisp and precise, and when you die or realize you’ve been going too slow each reset is pretty well instantaneous so you won’t waste any time waiting for your next run. Just with its simplicity and budget price don’t expect anything more than the challenges themselves, and if you like the personality the likes of titles like Super Meat Boy or the heart of Celeste you’ll find them non-existent here… so it’s take it or leave it. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/08/mini-reviews-august-4th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",10 Second Ninja X,Switch
170,7,"Simulations can be a tricky business on consoles since they typically feature more complex controls better suited to the PC, but the ones that get it right are sometimes a real treat. While it won’t be a flavor everyone will love, 112 Operator fits this mold well, though part of its success has to do with the relatively simple controls you’ll quickly become accustomed to. With the means of control out of the way you’ll be able to enjoy a surprisingly intense game that, perhaps at a distance, seems simplistic or dull, but when you’re immersed in the moment can be heartwarming or tragic at times. Your work as an emergency switchboard operator will put you right in the thick of things, monitoring incident reports and dispatching the proper personnel to handle a variety of scenarios. Where the game truly shines is in the calls you take, which will put you right on the spot to make sometimes very difficult decisions on the fly… which can lead to happy successes or absolute tragedy. It’s the unexpected that can really make 112 Operator compelling, and I understand that as you play it more and more the novelty of certain calls may diminish, but I’ll absolutely admit that having someone on the other end of the line relying on me to help them through a very tough situation is unique and quite compelling indeed. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/07/mini-reviews-july-27th-edition-nintendo.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",112 Operator,Switch

You can blaze through a few levels in a matter of minutes, or put a good hour into the story. It's a very challenging game and some cheap deaths get frustrating, but the quick restart nature doesn't make it feel that way.

The concept is really well executed, and allows for a very fun overall experience, particularly for the price point. I have 2 main issues with the game, however they are very minor. The first is that even though there are 6 modes to play, I only ever find myself playing 2 of them, and although there is customization in each of the modes, once you find one you like, you usually stick with that mode. The major issue is that the frame rate can slow down a lot if you have masses of dots, which usually takes some effort, then the frame rate can drop considerably, but if the customization is set differently, this is never an issue.",RedBlueCarrots,"Mar 17, 2019",12 orbits,Switch

It is a story driven game, so you need to read (a lot), remember and think to  really savour it. If it doesn't click with you from the start, keep at it a little bit longer. It is one of those games that made me sit there with open mouth, shaking my head and questioning all my understanding of the plot ... and loving every second of it. Writing, sound, art and voice acting get a solid 10, simply beautiful. My only negative is the fairly repetitive enemy design and the fighting part could be a bit more nuanced. The latter is entertaining, with a nice learning curve but in the end you can succeed if you just throw your best guys at it and remember the basic rock/paper/scissor mechanic.",FreshCuppa,"Jun 27, 2022",13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim,Switch

The writing is actually good. Characters travel to a different time period and actually experience different form of light culture shock. It's not superficial at all.Yes, it has small flaws all over, but that's all trivialized by the amount of effort, attention to detail and love this game so obviously got and conveys to the player. The setting and storytelling, the concept art, design references to cultural classics from both west and east, the sense of scale. This game oozes value all over and there would be too much to write.Taken apart, the battle segments might seem to lack a little in presentation and variety, but since most of the time is spent exploring the non-linear story, they never overstay their welcome. 13 sentinels truly performs a feat of game design to create something far above the sum of its parts.",Ayreos,"Aug 20, 2022",13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim,Switch
198,6,"This game is severely overrated IMO. The story mode (Remembrance) is interesting to go through for each of the 13 characters who each have about 7 chapters. However, I found the story to be extremely convoluted and difficult to absorb and understand. I had even watched some videos online trying to summarize the story and still couldn't even fully understand it. What a bummer, especially after spending over 30 hours on the story mode and completing it 100%. The battle/strategy gameplay mode (Destruction), however, I found to be quite enjoyable and addictive. It is not real-time strategy as others have mentioned on here. It is turn-based. All activity on the battlefield stops when it's your character's turn, giving you time to decide your next move. There are over 30 stages and as you progress you will earn ""meta-chips"" which you can spend on upgrades and unlockables to make your team members stronger and better equipped. It takes a while to truly understand all of the elements of battle and there is a LOT of activity on the screen, which can be overwhelming and confusing much of the time, but you'll get used to it. I put in at least 25 hours of gameplay here and still don't completely understand some aspects of battle. But I grew to enjoy it very much and looked forward to playing when i was not actually playing. I played the game over a six week period and honestly it is hard to recommend. Overall, I enjoyed the Destruction (battle) mode, but not so much the Remembrance (story) mode. I was not too fond of the game's style, either.",nep321,"Jun  4, 2022",13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim,Switch

There is also the Analysis section if you need assistance as to where each piece fits into the overall story, so you need not worry of it being too complicated. I won't say anything of the plot itself as it is best experienced completely blind. As for the combat, it is not as perfect as the story, but is engaging and strategic, even if the graphical style does leave a little to be desired in this particular part of the game (contrary to the story where the character sprites and backgrounds look fantastic).

207,9,"Lo primero es aclarar que no me gustan los RTS, así pues, no voy a entrar a valorar esta parte del juego (la cual complete poniéndolo en fácil y no complicándome demasiado la vida). A pesar de ello disfrute gratamente de la experiencia de 13 sentinels y es un juego recomendable si te gusta el resto de lo que ofrece. Así pues valorare solo el resto de la experiencia.13 sentinels es una mezcla de RTS y Visual Novel, que debe de andar en 20-30%/80-70%, lo cual quiere decir que para quien realmente no es recomendable es para aquellos que no les gustan las visual novels.La historia y la manera en la que es contada es sublime, original y caotica, mostrandonos los eventos de manera desordenada en función de con que personaje vayamos jugando, teniendo que ir ordenándolos en nuestra cabeza (con ayuda del visor de eventos que ya nos los coloca por orden) para ir desenmarañando lo que de verdad ocurre, con una infinidad de giros de guión. La historia nos muestra desde el principio viajes en el tiempo y varios momentos temporales diferentes para terminar de liar la marrana también. La belleza de los gráficos en esta parte es también sublime. Ahora el punto más negativo del juego es el balance entre las dos partes... o mejor dicho, la ""desconexión"" entre ellas. Una vez terminado el tutorial del juego, la parte RTS (la batalla final) y la parte visual novel quedan como dos pegotes separados en el menú del juego. Llegado a ese punto invertí unas 12 horas en solo jugar a la visual novel sin tocar la parte de RTS hasta llegar al punto que no podía continuar porque me obligaba a llegar a una cierta batalla para desbloquear más historia. En esas 12 horas no eche de menos la parte de combate, simplemente porque la historia te atrapa y porque tampoco le ves sentido ponerte a ello: la parte de RTS es la ""batalla final"" y el punto donde confluyen las historias de los 13 personajes, así que hasta ver lo que esta ocurriendo realmente se siente incluso anticlimatica jugarla... este es el punto más  del juego, aunque necesario tal y como se ha estructurado la historia (siendo contada a retales), me hace plantearme si era necesario incluso incluir la parte de RTS en este juego... aunque me imagino que fans del genero estaran en desacuerdo conmigo. igualmente, una gran obra maestra muy recomendable para cualquier fan de disfrutar de una buena historia.",Sunshadow87,"Oct 16, 2022",13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim,Switch

It was fun at the beginning but for me it was definitely too much of it and later on I was feeling like I'm wasting my time doing those boring fights over again, that unfortunately was necessary to push the story forward. I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes good story, this game will definitely have some impact on anyone if you just give it a chance and at least try to understand it.

222,4,"Plot is pretty good, though rather straightforward. As far as the combat, there are free games from 10 years ago released on the fire kindle that tackle the concept of turn based field battles. The maps for each battle are very small, which means any unit can cover nearly the entire map in one turn, rendering most obstacles used for cover useless as the enemies will be able to make it around them before taking their shot. Also each level, which take 1-3 minutes, only separated by ~5 seconds of walking further along the map before hitting the next random encounter battle, start to all blend together as there’s very little variety in what you can do. The music is intense, very battle music heavy, though doesn’t really fit with the game as it’s not adrenaline-rush gameplay as much as it is struggling to get the cursor to land on the specific spot you want your units to move to before repeating their one exaggerated shooting animation they do every time.",VitaminJ,"Mar 27, 2021",1971 Project Helios,Switch

231,2,"Completed the game in 1-2 hours. It left me wanting more, but not in a good way. Looking at the high reviews by critics thinking that they are suckers that got hit by nostalgia up front and gave high ratings, but normal user experience will be to buy this game and sit down and be disappointed.First, the “story” was too short. I have story in quotes because there was a vague little story about a high school kid talking very vaguely about how his normal dull life, but nothing happened. At one point there was even a “new girl at school” character, but that didn’t go anywhere. Overall a very weak non-existent story with character spouting out vague things that we can probably all relate to at some point on our lives. Second, the characters voice was weak and kind of low, and this is a big chunk of the game. Wish it were louder/clearer. The “mini games” were cool but I thought they were supposed to have a significant twist (according to kickstarter description) while playing them, but that wasn’t there. I call them mini games because some felt like you just played one level of a main 1980s nostalgia game, then it was over. It was cool to play the mini games but they were too short and although I had nostalgia for those old gams I played in the past, I wondered if newer generation would appreciate this and wondered if older generation like me would feel suckered for how quick it was over.Finally, this isn’t a spoiler but at the very end of the game instead of some indicator that the game is over you get a “to be continued” screen. At first I thought it was a joke, like the game was going to pull a fast one like “to be continued.....starting now” but nope, it actually ended. Turned out it was a huge joke after all because what are we continuing? There was absolutely no problem introduced in the first game to continue. All that being said and zero replayability leaves me not recommending this game to anyone. I paid close to 20 dollars for this at kickstarter, which I don’t mind overpaying to help make someone kickstarter project come through, but at the current price tag of 10 dollars I urge you to pass. Maybe if the game is on sale for 2-3 dollars. Even that might be a bit much since in the end this felt like playing a demo for a fuller game and you don’t pay 10 dollars for a game that feels like a demo with no story and no real challenge. Sorry, but nostalgia doesn’t carry a game and I urge all to pass or be let down in the end.",BusinessCat,"Feb  6, 2020",198X,Switch
232,2,"This was barely an hour of gameplay. You play one level of several different games as you listen to the main character narrate their lives and how bad it is after dear old Dad died. Or left. It's vague. The whole game is vague. You get introduced to people, concepts, plots, all that lead into nothing. A big ol' ""To Be Continued"" after only an hour of gameplay that was literally just 5 different games strung into one. There's no satisfaction to this game in the slightest as it feels like you just got started and warmed up to the concept, looking forward to an interesting game that somehow is going to twist up the play styles of the games, and you're excited for this neat indy game and how it started. Then credits roll. Save yourself some money and buy the terribad book Player One instead, It's got all of the references and nostalgia and it's just as disappointing, just cheaper.",Sargepepper,"Feb  3, 2020",198X,Switch

Nothing interesting ever happens to the main character, it's all just told to you.The gameplay and story are entirely disconnected and none of the gameplay sections are polished enough to be fun on their own.

243,8,"Review by Courtney Developed and Published by Limit Break Released on July 9th 2020 $12.99 on Nintendo switch 1993 Shenandoah is a game that I didn’t particularly think I’d have much of a connection with at first glance. Generally I’m not one for the smaller arcade shooter genre, and on the surface, I figured this would be another game that just wasn’t for me. There’s been a lot of attempts in recent years to recapture the nostalgia from old games, pixel graphics, the simplistic controls and music, and none of it really struck a chord with me. Right away something felt a little unique about this game. The art style really spoke to me. It was like being eight years old and looking through my dad’s bookshelf at his sci fi novels. It felt so familiar. And while the gameplay overall still isn’t something I would probably buy for myself, it still held my attention in a way so many others like it hadn’t been able to do. Upon researching the title, I realized perhaps why it was so different. 1993 isn’t just a cute addition to the title. Shenandoah isn’t pretending to be a trendy 90’s baby. It’s the real deal. This game began development back in 1992 by Krister Karlsson and three friends for the Commodore Amiga. But the group split and the game was never fully finished. Recently, Karlsson found the demo and decided to revisit the project. He and other developers came together to complete the title. The game truly is a relic. This adds such a deeper level to the game for me, and I really think I might replay it with new eyes after this review is written. It brings a whole new appreciation for me. I can only imagine how Karlsson must feel, finally seeing this game become a reality after it being boxed away for so long. The game itself is has fifteen stages, with many ships and upgrades to purchase. The game can also be played in co-op(up to four players), which I think is truly a fun addition. The game also offers plenty of boss battles, called sentinel battles in game. There’s a good bit of replayability here to unlock all the upgrades and ships as well. The game is short but sweet, with the easiest difficulty probably being around an hour to beat all levels, but the game does offer higher difficulties for those wanting more of a challenge. I think this game would truly interest someone who owned a Commodore Amiga back in the day, or is really looking to experience something similar. The game feels nostalgic in a way that many games try to capture and fail. If you’re looking for a game with intense challenge, this may not be something interesting for you. I think 1993 Shenandoah really is in need of a certain audience to truly appreciate it. Overall, I think it is a fun game, with really neat sci fi visuals, and a fun little shooter. For these reasons, my rating is an 8/10.",GamerGuysNGals,"Jul 22, 2020",1993 Shenandoah,Switch

253,9,"20XX is the perfect indie love letter to the Mega Man X franchise, while showing its indie roots with a committed ""roguelite"" design, where you'll start the whole game over again once you die, but earn the ability to unlock more items as you go.It finds a way to marry both in a manner that comes across frantic, fast-paced and challenging each time.Taking control of two starting characters with ranged or melee attacks, you'll dash your way through various levels of randomized tilesets and increasing difficulty to take down 8 monster robots, optionally take on their powers, and hopefully escape the facility.What 20XX lacks in any kind of deep lore or history, it makes up for with sheer high-octane action platforming.. once you get used to it at least. Expect quite a bit of a learning curve, and you'll be soaring through levels in no time.20XX is more than worth the price of admission if this seems like something that would interest you, and you miss the dash and wall-climb action of the X series.Just prepare to die a lot while learning the ropes, and if you're new and find things too rough, play on Revenant difficulty until you get used to how it all works.Granting 9 out of 10 ony because updates on Switch are slower to come out than on PC, and the game looks slightly blurrier than the original PC version, but runs just as smooth.",ChaosD1,"Jul 15, 2018",20XX,Switch

263,5,"3000th Duel is a punishing 2D Metroidvania with 3D graphics. The world can be fun to explore, though backtracking can be tedious before you are able to reach some of the teleporters. After the first few bosses, the boss design goes downhill a lot in some cases. For example, the Undead Monarch boss' second phase just phones it in. To up the difficulty in that final part of the fight, the designer takes the lazy road and just starts spawning other enemies in. This makes the fight feel cheap and not so fair. You’re not much of a designer if you're just going to do lazy, cheap stuff like that without bothering to balance it.The game has a habit of putting long paths between save points and boss rooms, wasting lots of time when you die and have to try again. The Tower Master boss is a great of example of both this and the previous point about bosses. This guy is super-fast, unfair, will kill you very quickly a lot, and every single time he does you have waste time traversing your way back to the boss room due to poor world design. This is completely the wrong way to design a hard game. These developers need to learn lessons from titles like Super Meat Boy. The player should be able to retry right away, not be forced to waste time watching an unnecessary death screen or traversing a needlessly long path back to the boss' room. Both of these things are known to increase frustration in players. Some actions have a pause at the end, during which you cannot do anything else. This makes the controls feel clunky at times. Another issue is that sometimes the player takes damage while doing the dash move, even though a skill acquired early on makes you invulnerable during the dash move. This happens most often in boss fights on occasion. One other thing would be that player's level is capped at a max of 99, which means you cannot unlock the entire skill tree in a single playthrough. This is another not-so-good design choice. It is a pretty safe bet that players that don't like games like Dark Souls will almost certainly not like this one.",Megafont88,"Mar 30, 2020",3000th Duel,Switch

Одно дело когда умираешь и происходит рес, с другой когда этот рес ради реса. + духота в копилку.- ужасный лвл дизайн и плохие телепорты (особенно в DLC).

Окей есть камень возвращения, но как вернуться к точке с которой ТПшнулся игрок? Почему нельзя было сделать телепорты на местах сохранения, как это обычно делают в соус лайках? Зачастую возникают ситуации, в которых нет возможности прокачать оружие или заклинание.- скучный дизайн боссов и посредственная сложность. Трудности могут вызвать 2 - 3 босса из основной игры и DLC.- даже учитывая DLC игра преступно длинная, надоедает уже на 11 часу и в дальнейшем не дает ничего интересного.- бесполезные статусы, которые редко срабатывают на обычных мобах и совершенно не работают на боссах. Из плюсов:- отличный баланс, даже если будешь пылесосить все локации и убивать всех встречающихся мобов персонаж (без отдельного фарма) не будет ощущаться перекаченным, не будет резкого повышения или понижения сложности, игра идет вровень параллельно прокачке персонажу.- сносная и полезная прокачка, хочется вкачать всё или почти всё, не забегая вперед по ветви.- нет авто-лвла мобов, если вернуться в ранее закрытые участки, то в них враги будут изначального уровня, из за чего импакт от прокачки не улетучивается.- разнообразный визуал локаций.- почти каждая локация имеет свой пак уникальных мобов, как на визуал, так и на атаки.- отдельного плюса заслуживает финальный босс DLC, самый динамичный и интересный босс файт за всю игру с достойной сложностью - победа над которым приносит удовольствие. 5ть воспоминаний из 10ти.",Zallen,"Dec 13, 2022",3000th Duel,Switch

274,2,"I just went from 6 to midnight! Oh it’s 36? Oh oh ok.. Fragments is a simple 2d platformer that relies on its difficulty as you try to collect 36 fragments of light in only one level, yes ONE LEVEL.  The mechanics are common to most platformers these days, left and right movement, jump and double jump.  The level is multi tiered and you move up and down through the floors until you have successfully gathered all of the pickups. First things first, I really love this type of indie game.  Very very hard 2d platforming that jumps you back into the action immediately so you try try and try again until the mission is accomplished.  Which at points fragments totally embodies, keeping me on the edge of my seat while i time out lasers to jump at the perfect moment to capture the light fragment.  This only works when the mechanics are as solid as oak, unfortunately that is not the case for 36 fragments of midnight. The double jump, which is one of the two mechanics of this game will randomly not work.  So if you are trying a difficult move to grab a fragment, at points it’s a gamble to see whether the double jump will work or not.  This is not a gamble that is fun to make.  The double jump has failed a number of times when jumping between floors, which has also caused me to fall onto spikes, ending a promising run.  Which is the sort of frustrating that makes me want to put the game down for good. Another pain point is the camera animation when moving from floor to floor.  This can only be explained as digital whiplash.  The clunky jerky movement, almost gave me a headache and caused me to dread every transition between floors. Aesthetically fragments is very nice, quite simple but the lighting effects and atmospheric elements make it a lovely place to spend some time.  I even had fun doing goofy stuff with the lighting like this flying bird. Overall, 36 fragments of midnight seems more like a game prototype that needs work rather than a published game.  Honestly, I can’t believe this is on the switch eshop.  With the lack of content and hit or miss mechanics, I’m giving 36 fragments of midnight... Be sure to watch my video review at YouTube channel TheFlannelFox",TheFlannelFox,"Nov 30, 2017",36 Fragments of Midnight,Switch

And it got all the pool rules right AND it even has a snooker mode, which is very very nice to have and a nice variety. Game modes in pool are 8-ball, 9-ball, and even 10-ball, and full snooker. The opponents get more difficult every game and feel real, so no unfair pocketing with every shot.The best part is: It even has got local multiplayer :D So I'm able to beat my mates while riding the bus home :) It's my first review, so please be kind ;)BUY THIS!",BrianZimmerman,"Dec  3, 2018",3D Billiards: Pool & Snooker,Switch

While 6Souls is by no means an amazing puzzle platformer, it’s hard to be too terribly harsh on it when the asking price is so reasonable. Very much playing out in a traditional style, the challenge will be working with what reasonably limited techniques you have to get through levels and hopefully try to pick up as many additional pick-ups as you can as you go. While not generally in the “frequent rage quits” class of difficulty, there are definitely spots where you’ll need to work a little harder than is typical, especially if you’re trying to grab everything you can on each level. While its combat is on the weak and limited side, the platforming controls are at least reasonably responsive, and while it will hardly win any awards it’s a very affordable pick-up that will keep you occupied for a few hours. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/12/mini-reviews-december-16th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 16, 2021",6Souls,Switch

That said, the mystery of your character’s past and this promise he made nearly 7 years ago that he only partially remembers details about makes for a decent hook at least.

Also entweder tauschen wir EINEN Controller nach jedem Schuss zwischen uns hin und her oder wir verbinden den jeweils zweiten Controller nach jedem Schuss neu. Das ist absolut nervig und für mich nicht nachvollziehbar. Gerne hätte ich auf der Herstellerwebseite nach Antworten gesucht, doch scheinbar gibt es gar keine. Auch im sozialen Netzwerk findet man keine Kontaktmöglichkeiten. Sehr schade und unprofessionell.

Do you like collecting? 9th Dawn III has kept me playing for countless hours and that says a lot because there are so many games I have bought on Switch and then just stopped playing cause they got boring but not this one. If I could change ONE thing, it would probably be the combat. The combat isn't bad, but you just hold the right stick and point towards the enemies to kill them. I might have tried to add a few things to the combat to make it a bit more engaging. I am still giving this game a 10 because it's such an amazing little (HUGE) game. It reminds me of an offline pixel MMO/roguelike type game. The world is absolutely massive and there are tons of sidequests.

321,6,"A Case of Distrust is a hardboiled investigative interactive fiction. It has very nice graphics, recalling both the Saul Bass graphics from the 50s, and the text adventures from the early 80s. The music is also appropriately sax-heavy and melancholy. It's not easy to write investigative IF, because you run the risk that players will step through all the possible combinations instead of wrapping their heads around the whodunit. In that respect, this game manages its material well, with a suitably intricate case, a good cast of seedy underground characters, and good mechanics for interrogating suspects. On the other hand, hardboiled mysteries live and die by the strenght of their writing, and that's where A Case of Distrust fails. The prose is serviceable at best, and sloppy at worst. There is nothing of the worderfully sarcastic humor of Chandler here, and the pacing is mostly off, with detailed exchanges suddenly evaporating in a disappointing: ""I asked  about that, but he replied nothing noteworthy"", and the like. The social commentary is also out of tune. If you risk something as implausible as placing a female ex-cop private investigator in the years of prohibition, you'd better provide deeper commentary than the usual platitudes on gender and racial discrimination provided here. Finally, the resolution of the case feels like a cop-out, and annoyingly unfair to the player. All in all, A Case of Distrust is an enjoyable but flawed romp that lives on the strenght of its core investigation.

323,6,"I was lucky enough to buy A Dark Room before Nintendo removed it from its shop due to an authorized easter egg. It's a weird game–an experimental work that must be commended for doing things that are rarely attempted in gaming. A Dark Room plays with time, sometimes requiring immediate action on your part, at other times encouraging you to put down your Switch and come back later (and in that sense, it shows its web/mobile origins). It plays with genres, starting off like a piece of textual Interactive Fiction, suddenly turning into a resources management game, and finally coming full circle, revealing itself to be story-based. It plays with the reinforcement cycles of mobile gaming, by hooking you into a very addictive loop, only to break it down almost entirely close the endgame. Above all, it plays with your expectations, surprising you with multiple left turns during its short gameplay time. After getting one of the ""bad"" ending, I'm curious to see what the other endings look like. As interesting as A Dark Room is, it's weighted down by a few annoying details. On my Switch, the game kept insisting that I should play with the joycons off–and that, besides not making any sense for this type of game, is also false, as I could reconnect the controllers and play just fine. The game is also very light on ""quality of life"" features. For example, the interface is ideal for a touchscreen, but the buttons are so small and cramped that I often ended up using the joycons instead. Overall, A Dark Room is an interesting experience that will stick with me. The game builds an atmosphere with a minimal toolset, and ends up being more immersive than its minimalistic interface suggests.

Unlike many other incremental games, like ""Cookie Clicker"", A Dark Room has a basic story, exploration, and a basic battle system. While the game is relatively short with a completion time of just a few hours, new gameplay mechanics are unlocked incrementally, giving the player a sense of progress and achievement. After finishing the game on the Switch, I did notice a few differences between the Switch version and the other versions, such as the inclusion of new story elements. The worst aspect of the game is how it is controlled. While the browser and iOS versions of A Dark Room were designed to be played with a mouse and touchscreen, respectively, the Switch version seems to attempt to compromise these two control methods, making both worse. I find the way that the controls are mapped to the controller to be very unintuitive, with several button presses having multiple buttons assigned to them, such as being able to move down in the menu with either left or down and moving up with right or up. While playing in tablet mode fixes the issue of the controller, I find that the on-screen buttons are a bit too small to be convenient for regular gameplay, making me reluctantly decide to use a controller. I also think that at its price point the game needs additional updates to its gameplay and UI to give the player more value than just playing the game's free browser counterpart. One interesting addition to the Switch version is very basic support for a second player, so making the game more multiplayer friendly would add value to the game as well. Aside from the issues with the controls, this version of A Dark Room is a good port of the previous versions, while still adding a few new story elements. If the game is put back onto the eShop, I hope that it is updated with better controls and more updates from the previous versions of A Dark Room.",CoolieCoolster,"May 21, 2019",A Dark Room,Switch

I wanted to just right back to the story..Which is a gift and a curse… I didn’t notice the hint system until the final 2 chapters.. and once I realized this was a thing.. it kind of brok ethe game for me… the hints do too much for the player… I feel A fold Apart would greatly benefit from a one or 2 hint per puzzle rather than the game just straight up showing you the solution… its like having the answers in the back of the math book.. why would you bother solving the problem if you can fold the final page over and just write it down… especially with an overwhelming equation…Overall though, I love the narrative focus of a fold apart, its more than just a paper folding puzzle game, its charming and emotional, you fel attached to these characters as youre chosing responses to text back and forth during this long distance relationship.. you feel the pain of both of these characters fighting to make this work… A Fold Apart is a great refresher on what love means, and on top of that is a nice little brain teaser…I give A Fold Aparta 7/10",SuperkenGaming,"Apr 17, 2020",A Fold Apart,Switch
326,6,"THE GAY COUPLE:Starting the game, the first thing I had to do, was to choose the two lovers for this story. They could be straight or gay couple — me choosing the gay couple. Two men this time, because the gay-love is mostly represented in any entertainment as between two women, than two men. So, my boys started with having a good relationship, but then something happens. The other dude took his dream job from another city and he wants to go there to fulfill his dream. They decide having a long-distance relationship for the time being, until he comes back from the temporary job. Well, things doesn’t go as planned. There will be jealousy, misunderstandings, arguments, ups and downs — but it all happens via phone, using a chat app. Yes, very mature. I’M JUST FOLDED, FLIPPED AND UPSIDE-DOWN:Player uses both characters, one at time, to solve puzzles that are based on a piece of a paper. It is like a level, that player has to solve by folding and turning the paper. In every level, player has to find the way to reach the star, which is placed strategically somewhere, that takes planning to get to. By turning and folding the paper, player can create new paths, which feels like a metaphor for finding a new way of thinking, as the character is trying overcome a problem. Turning the paper upside-down the gravity can drop the character to another platform. Player have to utilize all the moves and it might get tricky to fully picture the puzzle’s solution in mind. The gameplay stays pretty much the same throughout, but the game introduces new moves and techniques and I think at least one of them comes a way too late. It creates unnecessary distress to solve the rest of the puzzles. PLEASE TALK TO ME:A Fold Apart isn’t voice acted, so the game is filled with captions, some of them appearing artistically to the background, using horrendous font. The story is very basic love story and what they have to do, to get their relationship work. What annoyed me personally, was the whining, crying, moaning, attention-seeking tantrums, childish arguments… ugh. It gets old and tiresome, and makes them look like teenagers, rather than an adult couple with serious marital problems. LOVE WILL FIND THE WAY:A Fold Apart isn’t bad game, but it isn’t marvelous either. The puzzle mechanics are cool, but personally for me, it was hard to solve them at times. It was difficult to see in my mind how folding a paper affects the other side of the paper, so it was lots of trial-and-errors. Dropping new moves towards the end, didn’t help at all. It became frustrating sometimes, but thankfully the game offers hints, that will show you the right steps. A Fold Apart is a OK puzzle game, but I wouldn’t say it’s a Must-Play title. Only if you are interested of the puzzle mechanics, which are well-thought out.",onemorelevel_1,"Jan  1, 2021",A Fold Apart,Switch

The puzzles were challenging but not too hard, I never felt an urge to look up any solutions online. My main criticism of this game, however, would have to be its length. I got to the gate and expected the next level to load… nope. That was the end. It honestly felt too short (maybe an hour and a half of gaming) for the £4.80 I paid on sale. At its usual price of £7.39 I'd have felt like I'd been ripped off.

328,7,"Polished budget puzzlers that come over from the mobile space are always a bit hard to judge critically and fairly when they arrive on Switch. In the case of Snowman there’s no doubt it’s a smart, well-designed, and challenging experience despite what, on the surface, would seem to be a simple premise. Yeah, you just need to get the torso on top of the base and get the head on top of that, but the trick is that every move needs to often be carefully planned, whether to just get each element in place or to use the snow on the ground to make one part bigger to be able to use it. The first very fair critique would be whether or not there’s anything about this being on the Switch, taking on the ability to play on your television and use physical controls, and the answer is not really… this would seem to work just fine without either option whether on your phone or a tablet. The second quibble concerns the overall difficulty, which kicks in pretty quickly. It isn’t impossible by any means, but there’s a risk of getting stuck and without any means for assistance that could be a bummer too. If you like a challenge, clean graphics, and a budget-friendly price it’s a good option, but it may just be more convenient on your mobile device in the end as well. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/09/mini-reviews-september-10th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build,Switch

331,7,"While the content of the game is more than satisfactory, it has a number of technical issues holding it back. Firstly, the game frequently experiences noticeable lag spikes and outright frameskips, particularly when loading lots of particles/effects. While this isn't TYPICALLY a problem, it CAN rob you of the ability to respond in critical moments, such as against one of the Final Boss' attacks. It only posed a harmful problem 2-3 times in an Any% playthrough, but happened much more frequently (at least 3-5 times each mission), so I would heavily advise against attempting to play the Seal the Deal DLC (particularly the Death Wish content) until this is fixed. The game's other major hiccup is including a button to purchase the Nyakuza Metro content, which directs you to the eShop and instrcuts you to buy the Seal the Deal DLC, which does not include Nyakuza Metro. I'm not exactly sure why this was omitted for the Switch release, but considering the technical issues in the main game, I'll be glad if they do eventually release it, along with the aforementioned bugfixes. 7/10, would easily be 9/10 if the technical issues and missing content are patched.Review based on an Any% run of 29 Time Pieces.",Rikushadow5,"Oct 19, 2019",A Hat in Time,Switch

Cuando por fin salió en switch y lo pude jugar... en fin.Independientemente este es un buen plataforma en 3D, pero no vayáis con las expectativas muy altas. Particularmente me parece que algunas de sus áreas son bastante descafeinadas, salvandose únicamente como área de un plataforma en 3d el área del trato con el demonio y la de las montañas que es como un pequeño open world. Hay otras áreas que se salvan por su originalidad, que son la de cine y el barco del dlc (viene incluido).Así pues, el juego brilla por sus continuos cambios de ritmos que lo mantienen fresco y sorprenden continuamente. Sin embargo le falta mucho pulido en general.Y además, hay una parte que resulta horrenda para un juego de este tipo (al menos en switch) y son los tiempos de carga. En un juego como este, completar el juego no será problema, pero los niveles de reto (de otro dlc) son injugables, ya que un nivel que consiste en perfeccionar una secuencia de movimientos de 60-90 segundos para completar un reto, cuando los tiempos de carga entre muertes pueden llegar hasta casi un minuto... pues no merece la pena.",Sunshadow87,"Jun 11, 2020",A Hat in Time,Switch

Some occasional framerate jittering can be annoying when trying to perform platforming challenges, but I'm personally more annoyed by the fact that in some of the missions, certain textures completely bugged out for me and that ruined some of the jokes (Notably every point on the bill for destruction of property etc. in Dead Bird Studios was completely unreadable red blocks for me). I would highly reccomend this game based on the PC version, but unless you really want to scratch the 3D platformer itch, I'd wait for a performance patch.

Levels are greatly varied and while some accuse it of being lacking in focus, I think it executes strongly enough on each of these level themes to justify experimenting with such a plethora of ideas ranging from the mandatory stealth, to fast-paced gauntlets, to its signature open-world exploration, to even a murder mystery of sorts.

If you loved the 3D Platformers of yesteryear and just need something to fill the void left inside of you when Rareware disappeared i would highly recommend this game. I wanted to rate this higher but there are a few issues (at least with the switch version) i had with the game. 1) The file size was over 10GB and the game is only about 10 hours so it took up a lot of data and space on my switch for something that short. 2) The textures and graphical quality is a little on the 'low poly' side of things but it's very forgivable seeing as it's an indie developer and there are moments when i would become stuck in a wall or the frame rate would dropped significantly but only rarely. 3) The loading times on the switch are really long. If i found myself entering the wrong level I would have to load into it, load back out of it, then reload into the correct level and it could take 3-5 minutes to do this. Aside from those issues the game itself has a really cute story and i found myself checking a 100% completion rate and even purchased the DLC. It has everything a good 3D collect-a-thon should; mini hub world with secrets, uniquely themed worlds, a cast of unique and charming characters, and the game isn't scared to shake up the formula between styles of platforming and story telling. If you're on the fence I would suggest you just buy the game and sit down with it for a good hour and it will surely captivate you.

As you could expect from moment to moment the results can thus vary, and at times if you’ve missed some visual cue you may find yourself feeling a bit stuck, though thankfully the answer is always somewhere nearby at least. There are times where the controls can feel a bit on the dodge side, sometimes resulting in failure even when you know what you want to do, but for the most part you do get accustomed to some of the quirks and learn to work with them. While the adventure only lasts a few hours it is at least memorable, in particular because of the narrator who makes everything you’ve done feel just a bit more grand. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/09/mini-reviews-september-30th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
360,5,"I was enjoying this game, but as I approached the end game, it started crashing more and more. It just crashed during a boss fight I was most of the way through, and somehow took all my health/buff items when it crashed (I seriously don't think I used all of those). I don't think I'm good enough to get through this battle without some help, so at 92%, this might be the end of the game for me. (Other crashes meant I had a bunch of stuff to do over again, a drag, but not fatal.) More generally, I don't like that with this game, once you walk into a boss fight, you have no way out. If/when you die, you respawn into a locked area. So even without crashing, you can't decide you're not ready for this particular battle, either because you forgot to stock up or because it's a harder boss than you're ready for. Overall, it's a fun game with good music and a reasonable story. The battle and item mechanics are a little wonky, but you get used to it. There are some weird ways to get sort of trapped in walls and end up dying (so, a little bit of missing polish), but I was really enjoying the game till the repetitive crashing started. (I guess one way to deal with the 'getting stuck' would be to have an alternate save file, but I had only one save file I was using.)",RedPixel,"Jan  3, 2022",A Knight's Quest,Switch

363,3,"I invested a bit of time into this game and looking back, I wish I knew then what i do now. First of all, upon starting the game, it comes across as a nice looking Zelda clone. It is, upon starting. The prologue isn't too bad. The story is generic, but work for a game like this (Evil rises and threatens to take over the land). The dialogue isn't the best as it tries to come across as funny, but this happens 95% of the time, but it's not bothersome that it makes the game unplayable, but some of it can be cringe at points. The world looks good, art style is great and the music is great as well. There are various collectables, though you can't use any until further in the game. The bad parts come up quickly. The combat isn't perfect, but it isn't bad. It's what revolves around the combat is what brings it down. You can lock on to enemies and parry arrows and you have an unnecessarily slow jump attack, which is next to useless. Stun locking isn;t usually a good thing either side as it takes away from the gameplay, but you can't stun lock enemies, but they can stun lock you, make you go flying like a ragdoll and make you dizzy for a few seconds, which opens you up to more damage. Additionally, you can get ""Perma-damage"", which lowers your max health over time and can restore it using a bandage. No idea why they did this, it didn't need to be done, should have just had it do you get damaged normally. The enemies can also have elemental barriers, which you need to remove with a certain elemental magic before you can damage them. This part is what made me quit the game; The second dungeon/The Desert Proving Ground has you take on a gauntlet of enemies. Some have red barriers, which you need fire magic to remove. Simple enough, but the enemies spin attack, which brings the barrier up again and they spam this move and gather in a huge cluster to make it very, very difficult to both, remove the barrier and just kill the small horde as the window of opportunity to even do this with no damage is minuscule. I tried this section four times, but the constant barrier replenishment the enemies do was just too overwhelming and hugely infuriating. Up until this point though, my experience just kept going downhill; Your inventory is mostly locked at the start of the game. I read you can buy more inventory space just after the second dungeon, but why they even locked spaces was a stupid move. Zelda and other Zelda-like clone games never did this and the constant item management got frustrating as there is no storage system to store your upgrade materials. There are warp crystals, but remain inactive until the end of the third dungeon, which means you have to walk through the entirety of the map if you want to go back to a previous area after gaining a certain item. The grinding is janky. You get to grind rails, but it's quite frustrating as you have to contend with hazards on the rail, balancing, jumping to another rail at times and the camera to keep it in a position that makes it easier to see what's coming ahead and sometimes when you jump, he jumps off the rail rather than over a hazard or to a neighbouring rail. Also, saving is a huge issue depending on what you're doing. It autosaves whenever you go onto a new screen, but if you've done a lot without saving and the game crashes, you have to do what you did all over again. I don't know why the devs just didn't put in a manual save as well. Stupid really. It's a shame it turned out like this, cause when i saw it in the eShop, I really wanted to play it, so I got it at £3.99 when it was on sale, and boy was I glad I didn;t pay the usual £15.99 for it. I know I only played until the mid-way through the second dungeon, but because of that, I have/had no hope of it getting better, but if you have more perseverance than me and getter combat/timing skills, perhaps you'll really like it, though buy it when it's on sale, but if not, it would be best to avoid it.",Dronewolf,"Dec 18, 2021",A Knight's Quest,Switch

367,8,"Part golf game, part puzzler, A Little Golf Journey is hard to put in a pre-defined box. Rather than being dominated with a sliding power gauge and then concerns like trying to get your hook or slice just right, the golf side of things is decidedly stripped down here. The focus, instead, being more on planning out your path to the hole, and perhaps taking up a special challenge along the way if you keep an eye out for opportunities. Of course, the fact that a bit of a clever narrative plays out as you progress just further adds flavor and just underlines the title’s distinctive charm. If you allow yourself to get bogged down by the lack of a traditional golfing feel, or perhaps the camera that isn’t always cooperative, it may lose some of its luster, but there’s no doubt this overall experience is the only one of its kind on the Switch… and that makes it worth a look. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/10/mini-reviews-october-19th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch

372,2,"Esta review es sobre la versión de nintendo switch (quizas otras versiones no tienen todos los PUNTOS NEGATIVOS que me hacen darle esta nota al juego).El juego toma algunas premisas que en un principio deberían haber dado un buen juego al juntarlas (una estetica interesante, roguelike + mazmorreo-creación de mazmorras, multiples posibilidades de personalización del estilo de juego...) pero la implementación de las mismas es horrenda y francamente no he podido jugar más de 3 horas a esto antes de hacerle la review (normalmente acabo los juegos antes de ello), ni creo que lo haga a no ser que solucionen los problemas algún día.Los GRANDES PROBLEMAS de este juego que lo hacen de todo menos disfrutable:- La OPTIMIZACIÓN del juego: un juego de este genero debería ser más rápido y dinámico, sin embargo el juego es lento como una tortuga, debido a los tiempos de carga cuando entras y sales de combate por ejemplo, sumado al efecto de otros problemas como el control, que lo hacen sentir lento e incomodo de jugar. No son tan largos como para ser molestos si se tratara de otro tipo de genero, pero en este...- El TAMAÑO DE LETRA: el juego parece haber sido programado para jugar en un PC, en una pantalla de sus buenas pulgadas a escasa distancia de nuestra vista. Jugar tanto en portatil en la switch, como en la TV a más de un metro de distancia es suficiente para acabar con dolor de cabeza tras un rato...- El CONTROL: hay botones direccionales que no se pueden usar en los combates, moverte diagonalmente por el tablero es molesto... y no hablemos de navegar por los menús...- Los MENÚS: en un juego de esta índole, con tanta personalización, vas a pasar tiempo trasteando en los menús. Sumale los dos puntos anteriores y multiplicalo por 1000. Los menús de este juego son de lo peor que hay... no soy capaz de explicarlo bien, pero vuelve a ser algo pensado para manejar en un PC y con ratón...Creo que he dicho bastante y aún olvido algún punto... y casi prefiero olvidar... en serio...",Sunshadow87,"Nov 20, 2021",A Long Way Down,Switch
373,1,"There are just too many issues to recommend this game, even at 85% off. As others have mentioned, the input lag is beyond belief. I have tried to change tabs in the inventory menu and had it take 3-5 seconds. I don't know if the PC version is any better but the Switch port suffers from extreme load time and input lag. Framerate plummets, sometimes for no reason. In-game gameplay guide has confusing info and goes into 0 detail. What is a group vs a stack of monsters and why should I use a risk/reward tile on one but not the other? They'll never tell, and the game doesn't have a large enough following to find any info online. Icons are not distinct enough for easy visual identification. Animations are lackluster, possibly even lazy. Casting Ring of Fire has the same animation as Banishment - throwing a little wind looking projectile. Using the D-pad works on a Pro controller but not on the JoyCon. The controls are absolutely bonkers - instead of using the D-pad or left joystick to move between cards, you have to use...ZR and ZL? Oh, I should mention I never saw the end, because I cannot complete the game without creating a new file. You see, there's a main objective in Chapter 3 where you have to protect and retrieve an ally. While I tried to work towards this, the Gamemaster (who is not random, despite what others say. He will always use certain tiles first) placed a tile that allowed an enemy to come into contact with the ally...and when that happened, the game locked up. It didn't crash; instead a gray overlay filled the screen and it acted like I was in an inventory menu I couldn't get out of. I could use and discard potions and that was it. ""No problem"" I thought, ""I'll force close and reload an older save."" Well the game autosaved at the end of my turn/beginning of enemy turn, so every time I loaded the game, the same thing would happen - enemy runs at ally, gray overlay, can't do anything. And there's no way to stop the process and exit back to the main screen, so I literally cannot progress in that save file any longer. I need to delete it and start a new one. And speaking of deleting files, why on earth would you have the curose default to delete save instead of load save when resuming play? Why There is no conceivable reason; it's like they didn't have a single person playtest it. Luckily it does have a Confirm Delete option but that was a nasty surprise the first time! So yeah, I really wanted to enjoy it but it literally broke when trying to play.

There have been nail-biting challenges like Thumper, track-mixing and more creative games like Fuser, frantic dodging to the great tunes of Just Shapes and Beats, and more… a plain cornucopia of delightful tastes and styles. I’m happy to say A Musical Story continues that trend, going completely in its own direction with a surprisingly deep collection of rhythms you’ll need to replicate that favor constantly-changing patterns and styles over tying your fingers up in knots since you’ll only need to use your 2 trigger buttons to play along. Also worth noting is that if the game sees you struggling, it will progressively lend you some help as well. As sensational as the music is though, the real feature here is the incredible wordless story the game’s unique art tells, paired only with the game’s music to convey a deep and at times dark story that really sucked me in.

Support this man, as he deserves all the prase!He's often looking through and responding to forums, so he seems to listen to feedback quite well.Did I mention infinite replayability?  How many PvE games can make that claim?  Zero that's how many.Cons:  Sometimes randomness kills your run?  I don't like the randomness of the upgrade stations.  I wish their was an option to donate 99 scrap to see a list of potential upgrades or something.  The dumb overlord robots give you ""lil' whoever"" too much.  Also shield drones are lame.  Feels bad to get lame upgrades.  When you get something good that compliments your other upgrades it feels great though, just wish it was more common. TL;DRGame is very good, and was created by a single person.  Scratches that Super Metroid Itch for eternity with a new experience each time you play.  Roguelikes are not for everyone though, and some runs you'll waste hours before you see that luck has reduced your chances greatly. Edit:  I had some cons in the past but those have been updated and removed.

The big difference here is the rogue-lite element.Every death takes you right back to the start with a new random level/boss layout. This is really addictive because you never know what crazy weapons and power ups you will get each ""run"" or which new bosses you will face. The weapons and power ups are very interesting and varied and I still find myself getting excited every time I find something new even though I've killed the final boss twice already.The controls are tight, shooting feels good and jumping is precise. The enemy design is really cool with a fleshy body horror aesthetic. The bosses are really imaginative and fun to fight although one or two do feel a bit cheap sometimes (I'm looking at you headless, toxin spewing fiend).The only thing I would change (and hence why I gave it a 9 instead of 10) would be some enemies are a time wasting chore to get through especially when they respawn every time you re-enter a room. An example of this are the stationary blobs that release a small monster when hit.

The game is loads of fun , an built by one guy. Clearly lots of love went into the game. I would recommend it , appreciate it for what it is, a well built rouge like with lots of upgrade to unlock.

You will be glad you got this game.I almost didn't get it because of the name, but this is one of my favorite games ever. If anything, I am left wanting more. As you play, there is progression because of the items you unlock.  Some challenges are much more challenging than others, and there are now multiple modes of play (including a couch PvP version which is a lot more fun than I ever thought it would be). This game would be worth buying at its normal price on any day; getting it on sale is a no-brainer.",Calyad,"Dec 22, 2022",A Robot Named Fight!,Switch

Along the way you'll meet a hilarious cast of wisecracking animals who will teach you to climb, race, glide and fish, ask you to find lost property, share rumours and secrets, and more. It can be completed in 2-3 hours, but the game invites you to slow down and enjoy this game world. Finding every collectible, catching every fish and uncovering every secret could fill ten hours or more, and the summer day atmosphere is so enjoyable that replaying it is a pleasure.

The dialogue honestly was making me laugh. Great pick up for less than 10 Dollars. Cons: My only gripe is the camera angles switching on you can really mess with the direction you are going in and you can, in one spot, clip the camera into the island and all you see is water where there should be land.",Oscote,"Aug 25, 2020",A Short Hike,Switch

427,8,"Many games sell themselves as ""chilled"" or ""relaxing"", but A Short Hike is the game that I wish I could play again and again when I'm looking to ease my mind. Unfortunately, it doesn't lend itself to repeated play–and like its name says, it's extremely short. I'm a very slow player, but even I could see the ending of this game in about two hours. That short playtime, however, is not a shortcoming. On the contrary, this game is made even better by its limited length. For those two hours, A Short Hike tells a heartwarming little story, set in a nice miniature open world, full of paths to explore and side quests to complete. None of those side quests feels boring–you won't see any pointless collect-a-thons in this game. Everything has a place, and contributes to make A Short Hike a beautiful, if quick, escapade.",nusco,"Oct  2, 2020",A Short Hike,Switch

431,8,"I've got pretty late on a ""A Short Hike"" hype train, but I'm here! It's an indie adventure game that may seem like nothing special, but in reality it's different. Starting from graphics, it has a low resolution, but it gives an option to choose between smooth edges and chunky pixelated ones (I chose the smooth ones xD). Exploration in this game is what makes it truly great. In every part of the island camera is set in a way so the player cannot take a peek at some stuff. It makes the exploration experience more intriguing. There are some quests to do, but mostly it's the pure exploration. Obviously, you can rush to the peak of the island to finish the game. However, I cannot relate to people who rush games xdIt's a short game even without the rush, I think it took me 4 or 5 hours to finish it at 100%. To be honest, I collected my last 2 golden and 2 silver feathers after reaching the peak of the mountain... Soundtrack was comfortable, visuals were vibrant and colorful, controls were easy to understand and the overall experience was satisfying. I really adore the aspect of climbing as well as gliding in the exploration games and here both of these mechanics were phenomenal. Short and Sweet, comfy game for a one sitting!",Kacek1996,"Nov 14, 2020",A Short Hike,Switch
432,10,"A 10 doesn't describe how magical this game really is. The artstyle is great, but the focus lays on that journey you're going through. When you start the game, you have no idea where to go, what to do, or where everything is. You slowly understand what your goal is, climbing that beeg mountain, but you have no ideahow to get to the top. The time between between beginning the game and being on top of the mountain is one of the nicest experiences I had playing a video game. Even though you're playing someone elses journey, it feels like its your journey. Sure, the game isn't too long and the camera can be a threat sometimes, but thats about all the critic I can give this game.

438,8,"You play as Claire, a young bird who is visiting Hawk Peak Provincial Park. She’s brought here for an unknown reason with another unknown bird whose relationship you can only guess. For now, you know Claire isn’t happy to be here and is awaiting a phone call. The bird who brought you here suggests hiking up to the summit of Hawk Peak. It’s a climb that the bird says: “We’ve all made the trek before”. And you go off to do just that. In the beginning you’re doing this to get that sweet sweet phone call. You find characters along the way and stop to interact with them. You learn how to play the game, climb the mountain, and discover the trades to be made. But you also learn Claire is familiar with Hawk Peak as she knows some of the residents by name. So why was she so unhappy to return? Imagine if you will a more quaint and wholesome Breath Of The Wild. Sure you can bumrush it into the castle and good luck to you if you beat Gannon in your underwear. But are you sure you want to do that on the first try? Would you rather do that or climb this tree and that mountain just because you can? How about talking to NPCs and taking sidequests, just because you can. After all, it wasn’t the price tag that made Breath Of The Wild so amazing. But the content found inside that made you love every moment of your experience. Along the way I meet a colorful cast of characters who made my journey up the mountain all the more delightful and entertaining. I stomped around in rage because I couldn’t find the struggling painter to tell him I love his work. I dug every spot I laid eyes on to find a man’s treasured watch. Oh, you believe in me friendly kids? Then sure I’ll play a couple more rounds of BeachStickBall with you! Oh man, tuition huh? Yeah that’s a mood, I’ll help you out then. Every character you encounter is pleasant. Even the ones who rub you the wrong way, you know they have their reasons for being a little sour. Claire herself is a wonderful character to play as. You’re not given a choice to reject some of these requests like finding the watch. Instead she says she’ll help you because she understands how important this is to you. You are able to opt out of a race, a round of BeachStickBall, and finding the painter again. But she always says the right thing and the response from those around her is “oh hey man don’t worry about it.” As I continued onward I couldn’t help but notice the game’s sense of humor. Sometimes the dev just said **** it” in the bst of ways. He saved the heavy real world moments for the right times and right characters. But there’s times where you can break away and read a sign or encounter a character that contains a shameless snark that I can’t help but admire. I think the cute and simple pixelated graphics are what allows the map to be bigger than what it is. I had this constant reminder of how it was easier to fall and glide down the mountain than it is climbing up. When I looked down and saw the smooth waves rise and fall against the coast, and trees and flowers sway in the wind, the world was all the more alive to me. A Short Hike wouldn’t have been complete without its soundtrack. Mark Sparling has uploaded his OST onto YouTube for your listening pleasure and I will do just that. The transition between tracks flows smooth as silk. Each song gives way for one another as you enter different areas Hawk Peak. From the sunny, populated beaches, to quiet forest and rainy coves. As you climb higher and higher the OST lifts your spirits by cheering you onwards to the top. As you near the peak, the most challenging segment of Claire’s climb, the OST becomes more somber. It’s a transitional song. No longer cheering you onwards but whispering to you to not give up as you’re almost at the top. It’s a song about Claire and her journey so far. You can hear this song as you want. To you it may be about what brought her to Hawk Peak. Her entering adulthood or finding her own person at the top of this mountain. I think that the song is about her climb, forgetting what’s below her and looking ahead at her goal. And when you reach the summit, you forget what brought you here in the first place. A Short Hike is a game that you HAVE to savor. If you really want to get the most out of this game take your sweet time with it. Talk to everyone you meet, dick around a bit, help those around you, find, explore, collect. It’s easily a game you can pour upwards of five hours into if you insist on doing as much as you can before reaching the top of Hawk Peak. And I feel like if you do just that, the soar back down will be much more rewarding.",EnigmaXtreme,"Aug 25, 2020",A Short Hike,Switch

It's very relaxing...this game actually follows through on the promise of being a relaxing game. It's basically you climbing up a mountain, and then finding and earning feathers so that you can fly around, and flying is crucial for reaching the very top of the mountain. Initially the graphics are really bad, but you can fix it in the settings.

442,10,"Estamos ante un juego cortito y poco pretencioso pero que lo que quiere hacer lo hace bien no, fenomenal. Se trata de un juego extremadamente agradable tanto en lo jugable como en lo visual y en lo sonoro, y que se basa principalmente en 3 pilares. Por un lado tenemos la ''misión principal'' que consiste en escalar el pico de la isla en la que nos encontramos, para lo cual el juego hace uso de unas mecánicas basadas en escalada y vuelo y limitadas por estamina extremadamente satisfactorias. En segundo lugar tenemos el factor exploración, la cual es muy amena gracias a la ligereza del gameplay, y recompensa constantemente, aparte de encontrarnos ante una preciosa isla, no muy grande pero llena de cosas. Y por último debo hablar de las relaciones con los demás habitantes de la isla, las cuales son sobresalientes y están cargadas de un humor y una personalidad desbordantes. Este título bebe de Animal Crossing en este aspecto, llevando esa fórmula de sociabilización a una escala mucho más comedida, guiada (los diálogos tienen una serie de fases y de ahí no salen), y bajo mi punto de vista tremendamente efectiva y graciosa (te vas a reir bastante por las locas situaciones que encontrarás en Pico Halcón, nombre de la isla). En definitiva estamos ante un título al que no se le puede poner un solo pero, todo lo que hace lo hace realmente bien y deja una sensación muy plena tras ser jugado. Como único punto negativo podría mencionarse su escasa duración, ya que la misión principal puede completarse a ritmo normal en 2h o menos incluso ( luego hay modo speedrun incluido en el juego y he visto a gente completar el juego en 1 minuto xD), y completar el 100% nos llevará algo más de 5h (bajo mi punto de vista aquí es donde está la chicha del juego, sobre todo en desarrollar las ''misiones secundarias'' que nos proponen los habitantes de la isla).

The appropriately named “A Short Hike” is the most blissful nature walk that never outstays its welcome. It is sure to have you grinning ear-to-ear with every side trail you stumble upon. While short (the game can be completed in one swift sitting), this bite-sized experience is easy to digest and left a lasting impression on me. If it is not perfect, it is very close to it. Join me on this short review of A Short Hike. The feature most apparent as you load up the game for the first time is the visuals. Pixels are jagged, giving it an appearance of something you might see in the mid 90’s. I thought that it added charm, and it was clear that a creative choice was made here. Perhaps not everybody will feel the same, but fear not, because it is possible to adjust the visuals in the settings menu. After my eyes could not take much more of the large and chunky pixels, I switched it over to the sharpest image quality, and I was astonished by what a difference this made in my overall enjoyment. The game looks stunning with the more refined graphics, and I find it hard to believe that this was developed by just one person. As you start your journey on this small island, you are treated with a cutscene of sorts. It appears that there is someone driving you, Claire, to a summer camping trip, and then you are thrown into the game with little else to go on. As you take your first steps out of the cabin, you discover that your phone has no reception at the base of the island. You are then tasked with scaling the steep mountainside to make a phone call. Along the way, you will meet some colorful characters and have some amusing conversations, none of which are mandatory. This is one of those experiential titles, where you can play it however you would like. If you want to cut all the side missions and just ascend to the top in one quick swoop, you can. I do not recommend playing it that way though. The richness of the extra content you will stumble upon along the way can only be fully appreciated if you stop and smell the roses. Take this game at your own pace and be pleasantly surprised by what it has to offer. The music in this game is so relaxing. Actually, everything about A Short Hike is relaxing, but the music stands out in this department. I will link you to one song out of the soundtrack that gives me happy, care-free vibes. You can listen to it here on YouTube. The acoustic strings, the light bongos, and the piano melodies make this one of my all-time favorite soundtracks of any game. It is music that makes you feel, and this game really does evoke some strong emotions. While creative liberties shaped this game into an emotional ride, the gameplay holds up as well. The most appealing mechanic in the game would have to be the flying, or more appropriately, gliding. By holding the A button, you can float ever so gently, slowly losing altitude for every second that passes in the air. It is really satisfying to jump off a ledge and float to another ledge off in the distance. By pressing A as you glide, you can use a golden feather to flap your wings and fly, elongating your hang-time. You can also climb which will be crucial in making it to the peak of the mountain. While flying is by far the more appealing option, climbing will burn through golden feathers a lot slower than the simple flap of your wings, making it the more practical method. It is hard to judge the replay value A Short Hike has. It will differ from person to person. I am inclined to play it again, maybe in a year or two, so the experience is not fresh in my mind. It is one of those games that almost makes me wish I could play it again for the first time. The game is incredibly short, spanning only a couple hours maximum. In those two hours, I felt this was an adventure well worth the price of entry, but you may not share this sentiment. For those who are looking for a lot of bang for your buck, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are looking for something short and fun to get emotionally invested in, this is that game. I believe this game is a masterpiece, but I am also aware that it may not jive with everyone. If you thought everything outlined in this review is something you would enjoy, then I would highly recommend you jump on this one. I certainly did not regret it, and I am hopeful that neither will you.",XGR,"Jan 19, 2021",A Short Hike,Switch

469,7,"A Short Hike is a charming short story with a surprisingly lot to do. The visuals took some getting used to for me but especially in handheld mode on the Nintendo Switch that went rather quickly. The endearing story really fits in the small and lively open world. The developer created the right setting with the choice of colors and audio. The controls are very smooth, making it a joy to traverse the world by foot, wings or boat. The camera can play some tricks on you sometimes, but it certainly isn't game breaking. Also, the story is sweet, but in my opinion a little too short and, maybe due to this, not very memorable. However, for only € 6,99 in the Nintendo Switch eShop, you have great value for money.",GamePat-net,"Apr 19, 2021",A Short Hike,Switch

It is literally a form of therapy, while I was playing I was so distracted by the beautiful style of the game, the amazing music, the many villagers and their mini games and quests, and above all my mission to reach the peak.

476,9,"We’ve truly been blessed over the past 6 months or so with a strong run of generally bite-sized exploratory adventures that focus far more on the wonder of nature and discovery than the normal more action-oriented fare typically out there. A Short Hike, though only lasting a few hours, seems to have that perfect ratio to keep everything tight and satisfying, never having to wander too far before you see something to be found, someone to interact with, or a hint at something you may be able to discover later with the right equipment. Moving around the scenic park you’ll encounter a variety of people, some there to help you and some in need of some quick help which typically won’t have you tromping around to find what they’re looking for. It may not have loads of depth or character development but honestly you’re likely to be so enchanted with the beauty of your surroundings and the clean simplicity of the overall experience that it won’t matter a bit. A definite recommendation for people looking to relax or younger gamers with parents trying to find them something appropriate for just about any skill level. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/08/mini-reviews-august-18th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",A Short Hike,Switch

494,6,"An utterly odd hodge podge of styles and concepts, Synapse kind of throws ideas out there in relative abundance but the result doesn’t quite come together sadly. You’ll be doing some action platforming, puzzle solving, you can play co-op with someone controlling your helper character (or do it solo with the right stick), slip between realities in order to sometimes get some insights in how to solve puzzles, there are shapes and math in places… it’s a lot. The problem is simply that none of it feels polished or compelling, especially where the action is concerned. There’s no doubt that the look and setting are unique, and it seems to be trying to push its little world as you meet new characters… but in the end the bread and butter gameplay just isn’t enough to maintain a steady interest in continuing on with it. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/07/mini-reviews-july-8th-edition-nintendo.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",A Tale of Synapse: The Chaos Theories,Switch
495,7,"While I’m not typically a huge fan of visual novels there are times where one does something that helps is stand out from the crowd and do something that’s worthy of some praise. Over the course of its few chapters, this game puts you in the shoes of each of its three main characters, all young women with very different backgrounds and challenges. In particular it’s Haru, the young trans woman, who sparks the most interest with her own internal struggles as well as the tension her lifestyle can create when interacting with other people in a variety of contexts, to open at a spa with hot springs for pretty obvious reasons. While obviously I’m not able to personally relate to the challenges she faces it would be difficult not to feel for her situation, trying to find the balance between advocating for herself and demuring, and then how her friends can also get pulled in different directions depending on the situation. It may not be for everyone, but I always appreciate an opportunity to see life and situations through a different lens. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/12/mini-reviews-december-17th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",A YEAR OF SPRINGS,Switch
496,9,"Great surprise!As a newcommer to the A-Train series, I feel surprised. What a complete management game. It's a mix of Sim City and Transport Fever. I recommand to everyone looking for a great japanese management game.+ Well introtuced tutorial and some missions (some need you to be perfectionist)+ Lot of management possibility (Train capacity, control Stock maket, sell lands, buy/sell/transport material...)+ You can create your map/scenario+ Lot of trains (you can even develop/customise your train)+  Great character design (feel anime)+  Lot of customisation in general +  Infinite gameplay - Graphic (It's not WOW but it turn on switch and it focus on gameplay)-  Can feel complex at first but it have all you need to continue (guide, tutorial)-  The price, high but it's an import game.

497,9,"Behind a rather steep learning curve there is what is probably the most satisfying city management game I have ever played. The level of planning and strategic decision is really unmatched in the genre. Unlike city builders like Sim City and City Skylines, on A-Train you aren't a god (government) capable of making the city grow out of nowhere, but the president of a train company that aims to work with the government to achieve development goals. It's  the limitations that you have as a private company owner that make the gameplay so engaging and interesting. The simulation is quite complex but you don't need to understand in detail how it works to advance in the game (which can be surprisingly easy at certain times). However, there is enough depth for you to dive deep if you want and the higher difficulties will put your skills and knowledge to the test. It takes dozens and dozens of hours to start feeling familiar with the game and even after hundred of hours you will still be learning things and developing better ways to face the scenarios, build your lines, etc. The only problem is that the performance on the Switch is not the best. The game runs well on the isometric camera + low details + no shadows, but the lag in the menus is something that is impossible to get rid of and deteriorates the experience a lot. It is a small price to pay for such a complex and interesting game, however. It is a pity that this series is largely ignored in the West. There is nothing available on the market that offers a similar gameplay, as its focus is quite different from what you find in games like OpenTT, Sim City, City Skylines, etc. A-Train is a unique city management game, not only in terms of type of experience, but also in terms of the depth it offers to be explored.",klscaras,"May  5, 2021",A-Train: All Aboard!

502,6,"Aborigenus is an adventure platformer with light RPG elements developed by Flying Islands Team. In Aborigenus, invaders have enslaved your clan and you are the last hope to save your tribesmen. Truthfully, there is not much more to say about this game as it feels more like a demo than a completed game. Your adventure as the hero of this story is told through simple text screens and the occasional bubble chat to clue you in on what is going on in the world. Story goes as follows: clan is enslaved, hero gets new powers from a shaman, hero fights single boss battle and saves his clan. This all occurs in the span of an hour or less of game play time.Game play in Aborigenus consists of simple platforming that requires no skill or precision and is just meant to move you from enemy to enemy. In many cases, slightly alternate platforms can be taken to avoid enemies, but there is no reason to do this as there is no challenge to the enemies and no hidden collectibles to find. The light RPG elements could add value to this title if it had more substance. You acquire the ability to use three different spells past the halfway point of the game, which are completely unnecessary to use except for in one instance to proceed in the game. I would much prefer the RPG elements to be removed from the game if it allows for a longer experience and focus on the stealth mechanic that can be used to score critical hits on enemies.Complaints out of the way, I really enjoyed my 45 minutes completing Aborigenus. The simple retro art style is done well, and the controls worked flawlessly. For audiophiles, this game has some really great tribal beats at each stage that I can tell had a lot of work put into. At the full retail price of $5 I cannot recommend this game as in its current state there is just not enough content to merit a purchase over similarly priced titles like my recently reviewed Goblin’s Sword. What Aborigenus did do well is leaving me wanting more, which is why I feel that this is basically just a demo. Wait for another sale as I got this title at $2 so I don’t think it was a waste of money. Aborigenus scores a 55/100 for me.",BudgetGamingNA,"Mar 29, 2020",Aborigenus,Switch
503,7,"All in all it's a good game. The art style is pretty simple,but if you love retro, you could like it. The controls are very good and you can play with the left stick or the d-pad.

504,3,"Don't make the mistake of thinking that Aborigenus is some kind of self-conscious tribute to old Flash games. This isn't a ""retro"" game. It's more like some guy's first experiment making a game. It does look like an old Flash game, but only because it's equally bad. To be clear, the authors of Aborigenus do show some talent. The general art direction makes sense, and the soundtrack is surprisingly good–so much that it seems to beg for a better game. Instead, that decent sountrack is stuck with a game that looks like the result of a Unity ""build your own game"" tutorial. Aborigenus is a mishmash of half-arsed action platformer mechanics that don't work together. The whole thing lasts less than an hour, even though it's artificially lengthened by misplaced checkpoints and comically verbose text explanations that shift wildly from second to third person. After a handful of amateurishly designed levels, and a quick boss battle that could easily be beaten on first try, Aborigenus showed me the closing credits and crashed because of a bug. That was a fitting end for a game that shouldn't have been put on the eShop–especially not for 5 euros. I bought it on 80% sale for 99 cents, that I covered with Gold Points. It still felt overpriced.",nusco,"Jan 24, 2021",Aborigenus,Switch

It will freeze randomly, after a few minutes or after an hour.It's already bad, but to make things even worse, you loose all your progress when it happens...Spending an hour completing a challenge is fun the first time, but when you have to do it three times in a row because the game froze and ""forgot"" to save your progress, it spoils any enjoyment. The Switch version also lacks analog throttle.

512,10,"INCREDIBLE. It almost feels wrong to call this a game, this is an experience. Beautiful. Stunning. Amazing. Jaw-dropping. The most gorgeous game I have ever played. Plus, the soundtrack is just perfect in supporting the visuals and amplifying the mood. I was having a pretty crappy day and didn't even really feel like playing any games, but ABZU completely turned that around. Do yourself a favour, get this game ASAP, and then just relax and take your time with it. Advanced players might even want to ingest certain substances along with it ;) I seriously cannot find anything wrong with this game, other than maybe its short play time, but I was aware of that before I bought it. It's only 20 bucks anyway, and compared to other titles in that price range like Firewatch, it's worth every penny. Plus, I think the short run time makes for a more intense experience and entices you to replay (which I'm definitely going to do). Must-have. EDIT: I stand by my original review. However, I've now also got the game on PC because it was free for a few days. PLEASE, get this game on the highest-performing system that you have (high-end PC is the best one). This game thrives on its beautiful visuals.

513,9,"La exploración subacuática nunca podría haber sido tan hermosa y tan pacifica, ABZU tiene un aire muy similar a journey, con cientos de momentos que te dejaran marcado y que muy difícilmente olvidaras. A nivel de gameplay y narrativo este título es muy simple, pero esto es un aspecto negativo, en este caso la simpleza hace que pueda resaltar en otros aspectos siendo el principal de estos el aspecto gráfico y el soundtrack de este título siendo como mínimo bueno, ABZU es precioso, muchas de las tomas que se pueden apreciar fácilmente podrían ser un wallpaper en el pc de cualquiera. Unos de los aspectos negativos que encuentro es la duración de este título el cual se puede completar en unas 3 o 4 horas, aunque en esas horas encontraremos en una gran variedad de escenarios y una inmensa cantidad de animales a los cuales según el tamaño podemos sujetarnos y dejarnos llevar un rato, de igual forma y un aspecto positivo que considero es la opción de ""meditar"", en cada uno de estos escenarios existen unas estructuras en las cuales nuestro protagonista se posa y podemos observar cómo los animales se dan vueltas mientras nos relajamos con el soundtrack de este título. ABZU es sin duda uno de esos títulos que busca ir mas allá de los videojuegos convencionales, enamorándonos con sus gráficos y la belleza de sus escenarios, llegando a ser considerado por mi como una obra de arte jugable.",OtraPerspectiva,"Aug 24, 2021",ABZU,Switch

Podría hablar del juego por horas y horas de todo lo bueno que ofrece. Pero para no hacer eterna esta reseña solo diré: Abzu es uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en toda mi vida y es uno de los mejores juegos para la switch.  También es un juego barato y corto es ideal para las personas que tienen poco tiempo libre para jugar y no tienen mucho dinero.

515,8,"More of a swimming simulator than actually a ''game''. It doesn't have challenge (which is fine in that case), and no clear goal than just getting to the next zone. It's beautiful and the music is awesome. It's true that playing this with headphones must add a lot to the experience. I did it in several short sessions so I think it was better that way than just rushing through it. It also feels good and weird to just have fish to interact around you. I would have love more story background for this, because games these days tend to be like ''we only give part of the story and you'll figure it out by yourself'', which is sometime good (Hollow Knight) and sometime can feel just lazy. For this game, it's an in between. True, making a good and solid story is hard, so making video games. People should care more about this part in the indie world and hire writers, even just to coach them on their story because it can really make a huge difference. Also, the off-water parts were clearly not thought for the controls because they are really clunky, which is the only time in the game it appears, since when you are underwater they are really good.",Gontrand00,"Nov 29, 2020",ABZU,Switch
516,8,"ABZÛ is a short but gripping underwater adventure with spectacular art. Pros:- Powerful art: The graphics and the music combine to make this game a fantastic experience. A few sequences might give you the goosebumps.- Emotional gameplay: ABZÛ smoothly cycles through emotions that range from a calm, meditative mood to flashes of wonder–and even subtle anxiety.- Perfect diving feeling: This game is the closest you can come to the blissful experience of scuba diving without actually getting wet. Cons:- A “swimming simulator”: ABZÛ is a very linear game in the mold of ""walking simulators"". Apart from playing around with sea creatures, the only interactivity consists in finding and activating switches.- Small screens need not apply:  Playing this game handheld is like watching ""Star Wars"" on your phone.  I started playing on my Switch Lite, and immediately dropped the game until I had access to a giant screen and a good sound system.- Very short: This game can be completed in a single sitting.

There isn't too much overt story, rather a message of eco-preservation, which is fine. There is no combat or any challenging gameplay, which I think should be the case in more games. The most significant aspects of this are the design aspects, that you can swim with great white sharks while great music plays. I thought it was lovely overall.

Overall, the game tells a very relaxing and rewarding interactive story. It is quite linear, but you are guided in a way that doesn't lessen the immersion. Until you find the places in the game that tell you if you missed or found every achievement. Since you can’t go back to search again, this only serves as a reminder that you are playing a game, and that you will have to re-play it if you strafe for completion. You can play single chapters to complete the game. I would have preferred to have the list of missed and found achievements at the very end.

The environment doesn't really react much. There are a lot of weird transitions between some kind of other dimension and oceans.

It is sort of interesting trying to work out the story, but I've played this through twice now and I'm still not really sure what is going on! Unfortunately, there are 2 very serious problems here. Firstly, there is very little to 'do' in this game - it is VERY linear in it's design and each objective is incredibly simple and requires no thought. Secondly, you will finish this game in just under 2 hours! There are chapter 'checkpoints', so you don't have to do it all in one go, but 2 hours is an incredibly short playthrough for a game with pretty limited replay value.

524,4,"Ok, don't get me wrong, this game is absolutely gorgeous, I mean STUNNING, it's a  beautiful, detailed piece of art. Musics pretty on point too. So why the low review? IT IS BORING AF. Literally the entire game is holding R2 and swimming around these really pretty environments. Which may be fine for some people, but this is definitely not for me. When IGN said it was light on gameplay, that was an understatement. The entire gameplay is swimming, boosting, doing tricks, finding little robot buddies to open walls, occasional very basic puzzles, and looking at the beautiful environments. When I saw reviews on Steam saying it was basically a walking simulator I had second thoughts but the game was so damn pretty I wanted to try it anyways. I really regret paying for it, but at least I got it on 50% off. Wish I had gotten it on game pass instead. Maybe after playing more I'll update but for now I cannot recommend this game. UPDATE: Finished it in 2 hours. TWO. Ten bucks for a boring swimming game with no replay value. Sure it's pretty, but there is nothing to do. Only danger is non lethal stun lock. Only puzzles are clicking 2 buttons across the biome to open the door to the next biome. Only reason to explore besides visuals are finding bots for opening the doors, because collectibles are useless. And for some reason it really wants to force an emotional connection to the shark. Like, ok, why?? Also also riding animals is completely useless, so basically this game is swimming and clicking a button now and then. Final Verdict: The ""game"" might be pretty, but there are pretty games with, you know, ACTUAL GAMEPLAY.

Aside from the distinction of being able to fight in the foreground and background, FF2 is not all that different from SFII and in some ways inferior.

It is also very challenging (even on difficulty level 1 of 8). My advice is to set the timer to fast, get a few early hits in and then try to dodge your opponents attacks for the second half of each round to score health victories rather than chasing KOs.

I love the way you can VERY quickly skip through dialogue and other pauses in the game to keep getting straight back into the battle! The Samurai Shodown games also have a unique and authentic atmosphere thanks to their music and sound effects.

586,8,"KOF 03 está longe de ser o melhor da franquia, mas está longe também de ser um dos piores. Controverso? Sim, essa é a palavra que verdadeiramente o define. O sucessor de KOF 02 tinha a responsabilidade de dar sequencia no melhor KOF já feito, claro, qualquer característica destoante de KOF 02 seria alvo de críticas, e KOF 03 além disso trouxe muitos aspectos, inspirados em Marvel vs Capcom, o que é claro, não agradou em nada os jogadores competitivos de KOF 02. A verdade é que KOF 03 trouxe uma história muito bem elaborada, de cara nós odiamos o novo protagonista, e essa era a intenção mesmo dos produtores. Ash Crimson é sádico, irritante, pedante, abusado, tudo para esconder sua verdadeira personalidade altruísta que vemos no futuro KOF XIII. A trilha sonora segue o padrão SNK de qualidade, é muito bem composta, principalmente a música Splendid Evil, tema de Ash Crimson e seu time. Os gráficos também são um show à parte, a começar pela introdução. A cena da carta de convite girando como em KOF 94 é um milagre técnico impressionante, pois o mesmo hardware processa os mesmos jogos. Os cenários e os sprites dos personagens são bem feitos para o Neo Geo, principalmente os cenários que são realmente impressionantes para o Neo Geo. A jogabilidade, inspirada em Marvel vs Capcom, trouxe a controversa mecânica de TAG, com o objetivo de deixar o jogo mais competitivo, entretanto, justamente os jogadores competitivos, o público alvo para tal mudança, não gostou da mesma. A seleção de personagens é interessante trazendo personagens de Garou como Terry de jaqueta de piloto, Gato e Tizoc, e também traz novos personagens como Maki, a irmã de Chizuru, Adelheid Bernstein o filho de Rugal, e os novos protagonistas Ash Crimson, Shen Woo e Duo Lon, também não podemos esquecer de um dos chefões mais difíceis da SNK, o integrante daqueles do passado, Mukai. O legal, é que assim como Garou, KOF 03 tem dois chefes, e você tem que cumprir um requisito específico para enfrentar o chefe verdadeiro e assim ver o final do jogo. Embora realmente ele tenha suas falhas com o sistema TAG que deveria ter sido mais aprimorado, algo que vemos em KOF XI, é sim um bom jogo, vale a pena dar uma chance para o mesmo.",LohanDSouza,"Aug 20, 2020",ACA NeoGeo: The King of Fighters 2003,Switch
587,9,"An underrated SNK classic with a minimalist and ambient essence. The satisfying but simple set of mechanics, less detailed but still beautiful pixel art, the small roster and the quieter environments (taking place just before Japan's Meiji Period), makes an atmospheric fighting experience. It's less showy and grand than it's sibling, Samurai Shodown and certainly less over-the-top than your average Capcom or anime fighter. There's less blood and less exaggerated supernatural feats, with more of a focus on regular swordsplay. I find all of this to be this hidden gem's unique appeal.Also, as a Rurouni Kenshin fan, I adore the references (which makes me want to see this series return spiritually as a 'Rurouni Kenshin FIghterZ' of sorts).I'm glad I took the leap into trying this out.

596,7,"Goalscoring superstar hero! Tinker with the camera angle, height and zoom and you’ve got a pretty decent handheld clone of Sensible Soccer.  That is my quick first impression from playing a custom tournament of classic English club sides full of legends after a bit of a go with the player and team editor.  As I swerved home a great long range effort with aftertouch from Jay Jay Okocha to Nat Lofthouse’s head, the good feelings about 1990’s Sensible Soccer sessions returned!  The passing, the shooting, the tackling etc all feel very similar to that much loved game.  You have multiple difficulty levels, speeds, camera angles, replays, the ability to store a library of replays.  I found playing on handheld mode more enjoyable than docked. After playing I looked around the editing areas and found that you can edit player names and team names, but not abilities or kits (although you can mix and match home and away colours prematch to avoid clashes).  I would say that while the collection of classic club and classic international sides is very extensive (the largest I’ve seen before in any football game) - the actual font used in the menus could have been clearer for editing purposes.  At least it is there though, which means a potentially long shelf life for football lovers/anoraks like me who are interested in historical players.  The sheer number of classic teams is very impressive, must have taken some research and there is a nice spread of the legendary Eastern European/Soviet bloc teams as well as the fairly standard array of Western European classic club teams.  There’s a lot of South American classic club teams too.  Editing is better in handheld than tv mode I found. Career mode I haven’t had chance to test so won’t pass comment on and neither have I had chance to test out local multiplayer.  There is a tutorial section in the rather bland front menus and also a replay section for reliving those great goals which you are given the option to record during the game. Overall: It plays similarly to 1990s Amiga soccer classic Sensible Soccer when you have tinkered with the settings.  I don’t think it hits the same heights, but the goals are still very satisfying once you get comfortable with the gameplay.  It might take practice and it will certainly take patience with the editor to get all the correct names of teams and players.  As a pick up and play handheld game it’s a decent stab at an all time classic.",mfairhu1,"Apr 19, 2019",Active Soccer 2019,Switch

601,9,"I’ve always heard good things about the active soccer games as it was always said that it was arcade like and a spiritual successor to the sensible soccer series. To be honest..I thought sensible soccer sucked. I tried it and maybe people just have some sort of nostalgia googles on or whatever but I just couldn’t find what was so godly about it. I could care less about rosters as I don’t watch soccer because it’s pretty boring but mind you when it comes to arcade like soccer then count me in. I was never a fan of simulation because let’s be clear...soccer is already boring to watch to begin with. No wonder why Europeans go nuts when their team scores because I’d be pretty jacked up too knowing that it might take another century to score another goal. Maybe soccer is like baseball because everyone is to lit up on booze that it makes it more fun to watch which is true because I’ve hung out with people drunk and they were a hoot but sober were a drag. Anyways...I downloaded active soccer 2019 and I thought..maybe it’s like Mario strikers charged without the power ups and crazy hijinks going on. So I fired this baby up. The graphics aren’t going to tax the Nintendo switch but before the new patch. This game chugged and struggled. But it’s good now so don’t get all worried baby’s. So it ain’t a hot looking honey but it’s what’s under the skirt that gets me going. Well...let’s just say the gameplay stunk at first. I played it and no matter how many times I shot the ball, it missed the net consistently. That’s one thing I never understood about soccer. They are considered pros yet the net is the size of Madonna mansion and they still miss the net a lot. I tried tapping the shoot button and finally it was on target and the goalie stopped it. I tried to pass and one timer the ball into the net but missed it from a very close distance. I thought this game is garbage. I’m not having fun at all. So I deleted it. I thought what a waste of money. So I a few weeks passed and I read they put a patch out fixing the frame rate and gameplay somewhat. So I thought..meh..I’ll give it another go. Instead of leaving it on the slow speed..I put it to fast and wow..what a difference. It just felt better. Then it happened. I scored...then I scored again and again..sure I still missed the net every now and again or the goalie stopped it but I’m glad I gave it a second chance. It’s now clicking and I see why others have raved about it calling it fun. It truly is fun but you have to give it really a good chance. I went in thinking it was arcade fun where it’s fast and fun and high scoring crazy times. It is but it’s got a slight shot of sim infused in it as well. So do I recommend this game. Absolutely but if you find it’s no fun and pretty bad at first. Just get away from it a bit or maybe delete it and come back to it like I did. It will click. It did for me. It went from a 5 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10. Why only 9. The graphics could be better but the gameplay grows on you to the point where it’s truly fun. Would I buy it at full price. Sure but if your not a hardcore soccer fan then maybe wait for a slight price drop. But other then that. This game is pretty cool.",Jonnyblond77,"May 11, 2019",Active Soccer 2019,Switch
602,9,"I've played through the original countless times, changed the battery on my SNES cartridge once. Actraiser was the game, other than SMW and Pilotwings, that sold me on getting the system back in 1990 when it launched. Saved up a lot of allowance for that and it was my first real purchase as an ""adult"" of 11 yrs old. I was HIGHLY skeptical of this remake, especially since the first that I ever heard about it was after the Nintendo Direct on 9/23/21. There was absolutely no hype or previews for this game in any gaming news whatsoever. I threw caution to the wind, and boy am I glad that I did. They did a wonderful job of preserving the nonchalant two styles of gameplay that consist of the action and strategy portions. It is by no means a difficult or complex game, but what it does have- what it always had- is a lot of charm. I truly appreciate the art in the cutscenes that elaborates on the text-based story portions. I really like the ways in which the gameplay has been expanded: horde invasions occur every once in a while and demand that you fortify your city with tower defenses. It is still very basic combat compared to many other strategy sims we have these days, but again, that is the charm of it. It isn't punishing to the level that the player becomes frustrated. The only small gripe that I have with the strategy portion is that there is a lot of dialogue. Every time I am about to use a miracle or upgrade a fortress, the action seems to pause and take me to the temple because they have something to tell me-- but it is a minor issue. The text could have been streamlined a bit, but it DOES serve to help flesh out the original's bare-bones story a bit more. Now the action sequences-- at first, the 3D style is a bit jarring. When you are so used to the old-school charming graphics of the 1990s classic, that is bound to be the case. The hero has a light trail that follows him (a la Alucard in SOTN) and feels a little floaty comparatively, but let's be honest... he controls a LOT better than the very stiff hero in the original. There was never a time that I was pissed because it was hard to hit an enemy. There are more attacks now. You can do an uppercut-style slice, forward 3 hit, ground pound, and magic can be changed on the fly. In the original, you had to choose your magic before you started and were bound to that for the entire level. Also, the levels have been tweaked so that they are not as punishing either. If you fall into the water you don't die, but you do take damage. There is a LOT of new content on display here, including heroes in each region that help defend your civilization. Altogether, I was very pleasantly surprised by this unannounced gem of a title. The team that put it together should be very proud. They did a wonderful service to Actraiser 1990 and added a large amount of new content that not only fits the game but adds a depth to it that I never knew it could have. I am only at the third region in the game (6 hours in maybe?) but I am loving it so far.",Sandrick,"Sep 24, 2021",ActRaiser Renaissance,Switch

605,5,"Actraiser Renaissance is probably the purest example of a remake completely failing to understand what made the original great and ruining the gameplay experience. I should note that I adore the original Actraiser. It is absolutely a Top 10 SNES game for me. Quintet made some of my favorite games back in the day, including Soul Blazer. So I literally bought this without looking at the product description, so certain it would scratch an itch I have felt for years. Is the original Actraiser here? Yes! You can play the same platformer game which is generally as enjoyable as the original. The artwork is *significantly* worse when compared with Quintet's original sprite work, but the orchestrated music is beautiful. Unfortunately, the music ends up being the only good addition to the entire package. You also can play the same sim game. Your little angel flies around, killing monsters who try to do the villagers harm. You tell villagers where to build and to destroy lairs. You shape the landscape to make it more livable for each town. Yes! Actraiser is here. But it's buried under layers of new content. Somehow, Square Enix took a classic, wonderful game, and with every new addition (other than the already noted great music arrangements), they managed to make it worse. The most obvious and annoying of these is their terrible tower defense sections. I should note that I do not love tower defense games, but slapping it into the sim-portion of a game not built for it feels very sloppy. Make no mistake: if you complete this game, you will spend more time in tower defense than you will in platforming. By the time I hit Bloodpool, every time tower defense came up, I sighed, rolled my eyes, and resigned myself to my fate. There's also a new quest system to finish for each town. The quest system is made up of a few primary types of play. About a third to a half of them revolve around the awful tower defense. There are quests to take out the monster lairs (more on this in a few). And there are tasks that revolve around improving the towns. The quest system is bogged down in things just not working properly. For example, one quest might be to get a town to a certain population level. But when you do that, you can't turn in the quest right away. You usually have to wait for a day cycle to complete. For some quests to complete or show up, I had to leave the town completely and then come back. I mean, sure, the quests keep you on track, but there shouldn't be much to keep track of in this game: kill the bad guys, make the town big. Done. Regarding monster lairs, you can't just kill them whenever you have access to them. You have to wait for a quest to show up to let you kill the monster lairs. And then when you do want to kill them, you have to fly down into a tiny room and kill things inside of it with platforming gameplay. This sounds cool, more gameplay!, but the rooms are poorly executed. Most are just monster closets with tons of monsters that disappear as soon as you beat the big baddie, so you just attack/magic spam the baddie until dead. They're boring. Also in the quests, when you are trying to 100% the game, each town has two quests to go back into the main platforming levels to kill a certain number of enemies of a certain type. But here's the problem: none of the monsters you killed in your original playthrough counted, and you have to go back into each level *at least* two more times to find enough monsters to kill. Why? Why am I just redoing levels I already beat for a quest that doesn't matter? Square Enix really wanted to frustrate you to death here. One other thing that bugs me in the changed gameplay...magic is now done by MP instead of a certain number of casts each time. Additional MP is earned by finding statues within each platforming level that, for the most part, are very simply placed. Plus, you take all your magic types into each level with you and can change them. These two changes made most late game levels absurdly easy. There's so much magic and MP to be had that you can basically spam it whenever you want throughout each level and have plenty for the bosses. There's a new, convoluted story involving ""champions"" that emerge out of each city. The stories are nonsensical, and the characters are uninteresting. Instead of focusing on my villagers as a whole, now we're supposed to be focused on these elevated humans. Why is my angel wasting so much time talking to these people? Yelling at them? There's one other new thing that I'll decline to include here since it's a bit of a spoiler, but it involves almost entirely playing a bunch of awful tower defense, so just trust me when I say it sucks. I'm sorry, SE. I wanted to love this. I hope you do Soul Blazer, but I hope you let it keep its soul rather than whatever you thought you were doing here. Don't add, just upgrade.",BlueMikey,"Sep 27, 2021",ActRaiser Renaissance,Switch
606,5,Lots of problems with this one. This is mobile quality video game at the price of $30. The art style is a mess and looks like it was made by 5 people who didn’t communicate with each other. The side scrolling action felt like a budget version of Castlevania SoTN with overly stiff controls. The level design was as about uninteresting as it gets. Meanwhile the over-world experience suffers from some significant size and zooming issues that impede the player ability to understand what the heck is going on - particularly during tower defense segmentsI like the general concept and the IP.

608,9,"Let me preface this by saying I've been waiting for more Actraiser for almost 30 years.  Renaissance does a great job of capturing the feel of the original with more modern gameplay. It adds a tower defense aspect to the simulation sections, which wasn't necessary but I ultimately enjoyed. The action parts are less methodical and generally easier, but still very enjoyable.  Of course the music from the original is some of if not THE best video game music of all time.  The new versions sound as good as ever and I was smitten from the opening notes.The other major addition is the heroes of each realm.  This leads to more dialogue and more involved story elements.  I enjoyed this as well, but it does take away some of the simplistic charm of the original.Unfortunately, this also leads to the games biggest disappointment.  When speaking to the heroes, the angel refers to the Master as ""they"".  At first it's just confusing as it makes no grammatical sense.   It doesn't even happen that often, but that just makes it more jarring when it does. It ultimately has little impact on the game overall, but that's what makes it so irritating.  It could just not be there and everyone would be happy. It really is a shame, because I'd honestly give it a 10 if it weren't for that.For someone new to Actraiser, I expect he or she would get a fair amount of enjoyment, but it won't set his or her world on fire.  Fans will find a lot to love, but it won't replace the original.  I just hope it gets enough attention to do an Actraiser 2 remake (maybe with added simulation) and then Actraiser 3!",thryce3,"Nov 29, 2021",ActRaiser Renaissance,Switch

611,7,"I adored the first ActRaiser on SNES and overall was pretty impressed with this remake. The overworld is beautifully illustrated and animated, but the action (side-scrolling) sequences are awkward and somewhat ugly. I get that they were going for a sorta PS1-style graphical theme for said action sequences, but it doesn't always look good.  The music is a solid 10/10. These are the tracks you remember and love, and they've been remastered beautifully. The gameplay of the overworld sequences has sadly been ""enhanced"" and these new tower defense style ""missions"" get extremely old extremely fast. Once you have the heroes you like, you deploy them and sit and wait to either win or lose - I often felt that my own input was meaningless beyond my choice of heroes and how many towers I had. Unfortunately, the majority of the overworld is overtaken by these missions, and you'll do dozens before the credits roll - none of which are particularly good. They've also padded out the story with tons of in-game dialogue, but it's all delivered in Fire Emblem/older JRPG-style written text with portraits of the involved characters. It gets old pretty fast and there is a great deal of this added story, most of which is devoted to the new hero characters and none of which is particularly interesting.Overall this is a pretty fun remaster/remake, lame tower defense and overdone dialogue notwithstanding. The action is fun, the town development is fun, the music is excellent, and some of the art is amazing. I'm glad I bought it and will probably play through it again, but it's not perfect.",Nadblaster,"Nov 20, 2021",ActRaiser Renaissance,Switch

613,7,"Considered one of the best Super Nintendo games by a community of fans who have made it a cult (and very expensive ...) retro game for years, Actraiser was one of those games for which we really weren't expecting a remake. With his arrival, all the wildest dreams are allowed when it comes to the Square Enix catalog. So yes, the game has mechanics that are sometimes archaic and have aged badly, that's a fact. But on the other hand, the proposal we are given takes us completely out of our comfort zone, and Actraiser Renaissance is sometimes ""fresher"" and more original than some modern games. Available in a very well optimized Switch version, and at a low price, Actraiser Renaissance is one of these important titles in the heritage of video games, and I can only recommend it strongly. Full review, in french, on my blog Nintendo Legacy.

614,4,"Someone seems to be downvoting even moderate reviews (normally it's only negative reviews that get blindly downvoted) so I doubt anyone will be reading this, but here goes: Actraiser was one of the best early video games. It made a relatively simple sim game, made interesting by the inclusion of a relatively new idea: Lots and lots of characterization, fables, and dialogue! Also, the plot is a beautiful story about the unity of people in bad circumstances, and people should hear it out. Did you know that one of the very first video game music concerts was of Actraiser? Look up the Orchestral Video Game Music concerts from the 90s. It was THAT big and influential. But there were a lot of parts that I didn't like and that my family and friends didn't like either. For example, there are a couple parts where you get dumped into the sim engine for 20-60 minutes (depending how long you chase butterflies) with nothing happening except for watching people cultivate the land, which forces the player to get to know the engine's limitations very intimately. The pauses in the action mostly take place in Kasandora, although early Fillmore and all its tutorials count too. For another, the action game engine is just bad. Diagonal jumping is somewhere between hard and impossible, and there's no momentum curve (like in any Super Mario) where your character slowly picks up speed and gradually slows down when you're not moving. Momentum was added to the first Mario game to make it feel more lively and less like you're piloting a robot. Without that, Actraiser has always felt like you're guiding a fighting game character over long distances. Have you ever walked from one side of the screen to the other in Street Fighter? Even that feels like a long way to walk with that kind of a movement system. So, walking through massive levels with lots of enemies feels less lifelike than it could, and it takes a while. Someone else on here complained that this game was changed too much from the original. I actually disagree; this release could have added a lot more than it did and fixed a lot more than it did.",starrymia,"Oct 10, 2021",ActRaiser Renaissance,Switch

Not even close..but I still had fun..The problem with adventure time pirates of the enchiridion is that despite its 10 hour length to obtain this games platinum trophy.. by the way this game has a great trophy list..This game just starts to feel like a drag to get through towards the end if you are setting out to see everything, if youre exploring the worlds, collecting the quests... finding the penguins and little candy dudes for mission and trophy progress… and that isn’t because the world isn’t fun to explore.. It is...as you progress through the game you’ll gain new party member like in ni no kuni and they all play a role in accessing different areas of the world..I thoroughly enjoyed exploring this game for its secrets...it’s just that this games main gameplay focus... its combat just isn’t fun...it has the formula, there are weakness and immunities, there are status effects, there are consumable items and power points, there are special moves you find in chests and you can level them up with the cash you find and earn, you can also use this cash to increase your stats to balance them out for more of your play style…  each character has their own bonus special attack  with a meter that’s filled differently for all 4 characters, such as doing damage or taking damage… all of these things are greatbut when it comes down to it.. battles are just way too slow, leveling is way too slow, cash is rewarded at too low of a rate, there are annoying pickles and fairies healing and reviving each other to keep the battles going on even longer.. it just gets old super quick…don’t get me wrong at first things are challenge, I would have to actually think and strategize, but eventually I found myself just going through the motions.. Boss battles no longer worried me...The thing ni no kuni does so great for example is that sure ever battle feels like a threat… but they’re all swift except for its boss battles.. Those are the ones that drag out and really demand strategy and therefore the game stays satisfying throughout… there are glimpses of these moments here, but they’re just glimpses... every battle ends up being a drag by this games end even more so than its boss battles and that’s a shamethat’s not to say you should just turn away and not play this game because the rest of it is great, exploring the world and completing its quests is so fun…it just.. Picture a pokemon game where it’s just a bunch of pidgeys and your starter pokemon never evolves...you can stay out of the grass if you don’t care about trophies... but if you do youre in for a bit of a grind..Performance wise I only ran into a couple of random hiccups near the game’s final area where I couldn’t bring up the map or pause screen but this was fixed by closing out the game and reopening it.. The gem will also chick at times while transitioning into new areas…otherwise this is a surprisingly enjoyable game... I was surprised by it, sure the combat is no fun, but it’s passible... the real star of the show is its world and exploring it... hunting down those trophies and achievements...I give Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridiona 6.5/10",SuperkenGaming,"Jul 17, 2018",Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion,Switch

This second episode is more of the same, and all the better for it. It's longer, with more terrible puns and weird characters. On the minus side, the second Bertram Fiddle also doubles up on the first game's shortcomings. Some of the events and characters feel a bit random, tucked onto the story for comedic reasons. Also, like in early versions of the first game, there's a huge amount of minor bugs. None of them was bad enough to break the game for me, but they did make me lose trust in the game and wonder sometimes whether I was stuck because of a bug. And finally, the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. This game does bring the case of Geoff the Murderer to its conclusion, but that conclusion happens so suddenly that it feels tucked on. On the plus side, Bertram and Gavin are as nice as ever, and I grew fond of them over the course of the game. (After playing with my wife, she laughs when I use my Southern European accent to make an impression of Gavin.) The best side of the game for me personally is the way that the puzzles are often clued not through logic, but through oblique puns and wordplays.

633,8,"Played on the Switch. Adventures of Chris is a fun romp through a Saturday morning cartoon landscape that captivates the imagination one's fondness for that bygone era of the 90s. This is in no way a bad thing. In fact, AoC doesn't heavily rely on pandering to nostalgia. Though I was personally reminded of my childhood during that time period (and in all the best ways), it didn't feel deceptive. When you boot up Adventures of Chris, you get a bit of backstory about where Chis comes from and what his lifestyle is like. He's just a nice kid that loves playing Super Nintendo! (I can relate.) Although the pacing takes a bit longer than needed to get to proper gameplay, once you get over that initial bump, the gameplay is riveting and the 2D hand drawn art style enticing. And that's what drew me to AoC--it's unique gameplay and art style. Reminiscent of those classic platformers of that bygone 90s era, there is an interesting mechanic where you can inflate and deflate like a balloon to get around and is your main means to explore the various levels. There is a nice sens of progression as you learn new abilities. However, the magic feels under-utilized and a major missed opportunity to interact with the environment in the levels. But the controls are responsive and you FEEL like a balloon, you know what I mean? (That was a joke.) But seriously, I didn't have any issues with the controls or gameplay and most deaths felt like the fault of my own. You also, at least in Story Mode, get to retry fairly quickly in each room a la Celeste or Super Meat Boy when you die or pop, so that's helpful to keep me engaged. Speaking of levels, you travel across the globe from the United States to Siberia to Japan, each region aesthetically designed appropriately to match our various real world cultures. The bosses also match the aesthetics in design, and it's really cool! As for aestheics, I can't think of too many indie games that go for the hand drawn art style (Hollow Knight and Cuphead come to mind) and I personally love it. While AoC isn't quite as strong on the art as something like Hollow Knight (frankly, some of the character and enemy animations could use more details and look less flat), I still adored the Saturday morning cartoon memories that came flooding back to me. But without nostalgia, does it hold its own? Yes, the animation is all very smooth and colorful. Just a bit of touching up could have made it stronger, but I know how these things go in small indie game projects. The music is FANTASTIC! Aside from the core mechanic of inflating/deflating and unique art, the soundtrack is perhaps my favorite part about Adventures of Chris. Some moments even reminded me of Final Fantasy Tactics' soundtrack and that is no easy feat to achieve. Regarding the story, I enjoyed it fine once the slow pacing eased up early on. It isn't the best storytelling or writing I've seen in a video game (the villain could be more clever and menacing, for example), but it still does its job well enough to keep me engaged. The humorous moments got plenty of laughs and chuckles from me, but I'm also a person who hasn't lost that sense of childlike wonder. And that's the thing that's great about AoC: Childlike wonder. As an adult, I got that sense of childhood imagination running wild coming on full force with my playthrough. The game isn't too hard on Story Mode and it doesn't waste your time. For an actual child, I think they would probably feel the same joy and wonder if not more so. (Children always need exposure to magical 2D platformers as far as I'm concerned.) My final thoughts: Both a child and an adult can be taken away to a land of pure happiness and joy with this magical 2D platformer. Adventures of Chris is a solid indie game and one I'm proud to have in my collection. 8/10",PositiveConcept,"Oct 24, 2020",Adventures of Chris,Switch

635,7,"Story You play as an overweight boy named Chris, who didn’t believe in himself. One day on his way home, he was pulled into a portal and turned by a vampire into a human balloon to decorate his birthday party. Somehow the boy managed to escape and he wanted to save some other kids that were also captured and turned into human toys. However, those kids had been given as a gift to other monsters from different places. As the main protagonist, you have to literally travel the world to save them. Mechanics/gameplay Imagine you were a human balloon. Yes, that’s how you would play the game. You could bounce on a surface and stay afloat in the air and be destroyed easily by sharp objects like spikes. The game also has some Metroidvania elements as you need to acquire some skills to reach a certain area. The game is area-based, meaning that you can visit any country (campaign) first. Although action platforming is the core gameplay, you are not limited to just jumping and floating. There’re more skills/abilities to learn too! Sometimes you do quests, while some other times you kind of explore an area. For some boss fights, you have to learn about their patterns, but for some other bosses, it’s more like a puzzle solving. I think there is a good variety to the game. However, also bear in mind that the game is very challenging. And you would die a lot. The dialogues are also interesting, and I almost never skipped any. Graphics/music The art style might look generic or just okay. But the effects (like attack/skills effects) are gorgeous! The music is not most memorable. However, it can be entertaining enough and serve its purpose very well. Conclusion The Adventures of Chris is not a typical action platformer! It is also challenging but in a good way, which gives me a sense of “im getting it. Just one more try!” The game has a good variety and very entertaining. It really kept me engaged. Surprisingly, I consider the gameplay to be as enjoyable as most AAA titles I’ve played this year.",CasualTap,"Oct 16, 2021",Adventures of Chris,Switch

There is some good gameplay and a lot of fun ideas, great character and world design, but it just never gets past the fun you have in the first few levels.

The number of times I died because the dash or jump button failed to register is shameful. Commig to this after Celeste just feels bad, it feels like my controller went back to NES days and can’t handle two simultaneous button presses. As you progress what was fun tower defense in the first few levels slowly transforms into gimmicky levels with a redundant difficulty curve. By level 5.1 I realized that despite my desire to finish this game, I am not having any fun. Maybe it’s cos I’m not playing co-op, maybe it’s cos I want this game to be a tower defense and it isn’t (you don’t get enough resources to play it TD style, you need to spend most of your time shooting) and maybe it’s cos this game tries to be a platformer but doesn’t have the control,s for it. Either way, I am not having fun, which is a shame since the potential is there and the game is interesting, just amateurishly made. I will come back and revise my review if the game gets the fun patched back in, they did fix some of the **** difficulty issues, but I doubt it. TL;DR Don’t bother.

The problem is that the game lacks of extension, i tought this game would be more of a platform game with huge amount of puzzles, bosses, diversity on materials to build stuff, but no. The game is not even a 50/50 of platform/tower defense, tower defense is the last thing you will do in every mission and it won't last that much. The platform side, its' also too short and not that great to what it could be. Also, the controllers are a mess its hard to manipulate everything in SOLO mode, buttons don't respond that smooth in some cases making it frustrating to play. The friendly AI is very dumb, you literally have to do everything to survive. I started playing on hard mode by my own but damn, its nearly impossible to do that alone so i changed to Normal (i would remained on Hard if i was playing coop). In general, this game should cost 10-15 dlls at most from what is now.

641,8,"Aegis Defenders is a pretty good game that deserved to get a bit more attention than it did. In some ways it succeeds and in others it fails, but I would still recommend it to most people interested in Tower Defense/indie games with a good art style. The game is a mix between a TD and an action platformer, with 1 or 2 players controlling 2-4 characters (the number increases the farther you get into the game). Each character has specific structures that can be built (some of which require ingredients from 2 or more players), unique weapons, and a special ability. Every element can be upgraded. Personally, I challenged myself by finishing the game on 1P mode and insane difficulty without backtracking to previous levels. I suggest others do the same if they don't have a friend to play with. The game succeeds in being engaging, even if not always extremely fun. You quickly get thrown into this gameplay loop of challenge rewarded by extra story and your own choice of upgrades. In terms of story, the game is pretty good but not excellent, though it hits high notes from time to time. The characters are only decent. Outside of the story, the game has enough variance to where it hardly ever feels boring. Over time, certain structures start to be unlocked and some structures lose value as you generally have more resources available. At some point, I felt I had reason to use almost every structure, weapon, and character at least a few times. The flaws that this game does have are pretty huge. For one, there were a few minor glitches I encountered. Besides that, most levels have an exploratory phase before the tower defense phase. These are used for tutorials and puzzles (of which only a few are excellent), but hardly ever for platforming. Even the tower defense has more platforming because it requires you to collect and manage resources with a time limit. While juggling between characters to accomplish this is fun to some extent, the AI is too incompetent when you're not controlling a character. It's always rooted in once place and doesn't attack unless an enemy is very close, and when it does it's at a low firing rate. While the character combat is made more engaging by having to stay on your toes and adapt, fighting enemies usually means staying in one place and shooting. Some of the systems in place are easy to forget about. The game gives you a limited number of player hearts, but they are easily replenished so they're mostly easy to forget about. On occasion, I even forgot some of my characters had special abilities because I hardly used them. That being said, adapting around some of the game's flaws is much of what makes it so special. You have to see what works and what doesn't with your limitations and understand how to manage characters most efficiently. For example, it might be necessary to bring a character somewhere to repair buildings, another to work on a resource generator, another to stand by an enemy spawn where the enemies are of the same color so they take extra damage, and another to be controlled to extract resources. Then you can use one of the same characters as an anchor, using the ""follow"" command to bring the resource miner back more quickly. It's stressful at first, but once you get used to it it's all good, strategic fun with a huge level of depth and variety. Overall score: 7.5 out of 10",UsernameIThink,"Apr 22, 2018",Aegis Defenders,Switch

643,5,Never quite finished Aegis Defenders. It seemed like a game I'd enjoy but I set it aside for a while and could not get back in it. Game(s) like: Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare (real time tower defense) maybe mixed in with some simple 2D platforming Pros:- Awesome concept Cons:- Both the platforming and the tower defense were just ok- The tower defense especially was not enjoyable.  I could put a defense down and the layout made it unclear if it would actually hit certain entry points- I personally did not like the graphics- Gather resources between waves felt unnecessary,jeffbizloc,"Oct 16, 2019",Aegis Defenders,Switch
644,7,"If you’re a big fan of fast-moving and often intense platforming action Aeon Drive will likely have some appeal for you. With only 30 seconds to finish each stage, though you do have the power to prolong your time limit if you collect enough gems, it definitely has an emphasis on execution. What’s a bit odd, though, is that there are absolutely things to the periphery, encouraging you to experiment with the paths you take, but I’m just not sure the need to explore and take chances is incentivized enough beyond the mere fact that you know things are there to collect. As you progress you’ll absolutely need to work out paths that are more efficient, typically involving some precision throws of your dagger that will allow you to teleport to it once it sticks in a surface, but once you survive aside from returning to shave off some seconds or try to collect things for giggles I’m don’t see a clear big picture incentive to expend the effort.

647,5,"It’s always interesting to see developers take some pretty big swings for the fences, trying out new variations in play style to forge a path of their own. The downside is that when such swings fail to connect the results can be a bit painful. I can’t fault the ambitious idea behind Aeon Must Die, trying to mix the feel of a side-scrolling beat-em-up with more of a technical fighting mentality, and on that level the result is actually interesting. In order to discourage you from just locking into the same attack pattern that works against all comers, as can sometimes happen with the genre, Aeon has a heat gauge that you’ll need to constantly keep an eye on and manage through the use of different attacks and defensive moves. This added layer of complexity, aside from simply trying not to get beaten up, does create some tension and initially it helps the gameplay feel pretty fresh. Sadly, it doesn’t take long before you’ll still inevitably lock into some pretty set patterns, simply responding to your status gauge position on a consistent basis to keep it in check. Add to that some problems where performance can feel inconsistent and a bit jerky at times and the overall experience ends up feeling like it has potential, it just can’t figure out how to make it all more compelling to keep coming back to. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/10/mini-reviews-october-19th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",Aeon Must Die!,Switch

649,6,"There are many missteps in this game, but it is worth playing if you like low-poly adventure games and don't mind the short length. The level design for temples leaves a lot to be desired. I had to reference walkthrough videos for every temple because the layout and objects activated by switches are not intuitive. For example, several times I would activate a switch, which would lead to a cutscene of an object near me, then I would get lost trying to figure out how to get to the referenced object. Often, the switch also activated a doorway in an earlier part of the dungeon, but with no indication that I'd have to backtrack to that door. Also, I feel that this game could have been better if it had either voice acted dialogue, or done away with the dialogue completely. There is an attempt at world building, but the core loop boils down to asking a villager where to go next, then just flying north, east, south, or west until you get there. Sound design was good, with good use of contextual sounds in temples. The song choice in the overworld is unobtrusive, but I personally didn't like most of it. As previously stated, it is short, but I do not fault the game for that. I like short games, but I felt that the ending was poorly handled. Overall, the game makes enough mistakes to lower it's rating, but I did enjoy it enough to finish.",softcornpore,"May  5, 2020",AER: Memories of Old,Switch
650,10,"Obtained one or two years ago with a GameStar magazine and liked it very much. The flight passages feel great, in a relaxing manner. So, when I saw it at 9,99€, I repurchased for the Switch. Compared to other ""free flight"" games it has the advantage of steering the exploration with a simple story. Sadly, the indoor passages don't quite live up to the good feeling of the outdoor, and it feels like the game could have expanded more on the outdoor world building. But that's mostly nitpicking on my side. On the switch it slightly suffers from the joy cons, which are markedly less precise than an XBox one controller (especially for camera controls), and I think it is locked to a lower frame rate than on PC. But those are general weaknesses of the platform appearing in all games, so it shouldn't be help against the game I guess.",Yael_at,"Apr  5, 2020",AER: Memories of Old,Switch
651,8,"Great game for sensitive souls. Don't expect complex gameplay or epic raging battles. This game is more like a piece of art. It has an excellent, relaxing atmosphere. For me, the feeling of freedom and speed when flying is the strongest lasting impression. The story is not forced on you, rather it unfolds slowly as you explore and discover pieces of it. I can only describe the overall experience as spiritual, deep, full of visual bliss. The graphics look a bit basic at first, however not only it does not matter, but somehow it ends up doing much better job visually than if it was fully smoothed out and textured. It has to be the warm lighting and colors, which are put together well. The flight itself feels great, although I'd highly recommend using a gamepad. The keyboard gets the job done too, but does not allow you to fly near as gracefully, which would be a miss. The only downside for me is that camera angle resets to forward view after a while, if you look around mid-flight. The bird form allows you to go so fast you can travel around the whole world easily. This is both good and bad, as the world can feel bit smaller, on the other hand, you never get bored by long travel from A to B. The absence of damage and death scared me at first, but I didn't really miss it in the end. The game is about discovering a story, enjoying the flying and exploration, not fights. When I fumbled a pass and crashed, I felt embarrassed enough to be less reckless next time, and thus no blood or death screen was really necessary. Sadly, the game is very short, once you figure out what to do. Knowing that from the start, I found the length to be quite OK-ish, as longer story would require some more complex mechanics in order not to get boring. Overall feel: Well suited game to just slow down and relax.",akwky,"Dec  9, 2020",AER: Memories of Old,Switch
652,8,A good game from start to end. Its flight sequences are very enjoyable but when you are indoors it fails to compare. Its story is enjoyable but short.

656,7,"This is one of those titles where I'm a bit torn in terms of how I feel about it. Starting with the positive Never Yield absolutely has style to spare from its terrific soundtrack to its colorful visuals to its somewhat weird-but-cinematic story. Putting all of those elements together you're absolutely sucked in for a bit as you drink it all in, steadily applying your somewhat limited repertoire of moves to new situations to deal with a variety of threats. However, I also think there's a point where you'll realize that for all of the production value it brings to the table, underneath it all the actual gameplay itself is quite simple. With that in mind, whether you'll enjoy the game will revolve around what you're looking for. If you want to feel a bit like you're playing through a movie of sorts (with the total length being roughly the same) you'll likely dig it a ton, if you're looking for rewarding gameplay you'll likely find it unsatisfying.

The Aery series has generally been laser focused on that goal, featuring a pretty basic set of controls for flying the bird you control along through a variety of settings without any real pressure to do anything before you’re ready to. In each environment you visit there’ll be a limited number of feathers to pick up, and with each you collect a new rumination on life and the universe will be shared. Each stage represents an era in the evolution of the planet.

661,0,"There are two kinds of games: Ones that let you use the dpad or the left stick to navigate menus, and ones that only let you use the left analog stick. This is the latter. The control sensitivity setting in the options is called ""sensibility"" instead of ""sensitivity"". The frame rate dips below 5FPS constantly and not because my Switch is damaged or something, because they try to show 10,000 objects on the screen at once for no reason. The game has no UI and gives you no idea what to do. Colliding with anything for any reason resets a lot of your progress. The gameplay itself is miserable fetch quests where you search for hidden objects that are the same color as the environment and are surrounded by vines and leaves and other things you could crash into and have to restart (for the ""challenge""). There are way too many hidden objects to fetch in a level. Like 20 instead of 3 or 4. Each level takes hours as you fly carefully around every part of the map from every angle and still miss an object until you notice it on the 40th flyby. Load times are 1-2 minutes when you change maps and there isn't always a loading screen, sometimes the game just freezes and you have to guess. The game is about floating islands, but some floating objects are still wrong. Floating islands I can understand, but every now and then you will run into a bush or a forest just hanging in the air, for no reason, with no quest items in it. Those are just glitches, they're not on purpose. You can't change your speed, really. First flying game of any kind that I've played with no brakes and you can't pull up to slow down. Your only speed is ""too fast"". In indie gaming, one of the worst trends is something I call ""I guess I made a puzzle game."" That's when a developer wants to make something amazing, but then they realize that they're terrible at programming gameplay elements, and so they just make a simple walking simulator or puzzle. This has all the elements of a good game - beautiful graphics, detailed areas, very talented background music - but no gameplay. With no user interface at all and gameplay that just involves flying through shiny objects, it's easy to guess that the developer would like to do more, but they're simply unable due to lack of skill or knowledge. I'm all for freedom and letting every developer have an audience, but this sort of game is why people with more common sense than me tend to prefer tightly curated gaming markets, where developers must measure up to bare minimum quality requirements. This feels like nothing more than a bare-bones tutorial for moving game characters around that the developer downloaded and put their own graphics into.",starrymia,"Oct 10, 2021",Aery - Sky Castle,Switch

663,6,"The only survivor of the village Ridgerode, Freya will seek revenge upon its destroyer, Beladim.  An immortal-ish demon, whose power is drawn from a magical rod he uses to rewind time when hurt.  Freya will hack and slash her way through multiple 2 and half a D dimensions in her journey to annihilate him. AeternoBlade is an action side-scrolling metroidvania-lite where you’ll be fighting numerous demons, maneuvering through some deadly environmental hazards, and solving some very dull environmental puzzles with your time-bending mechanics. Moving left and right you also have a jump button and an attack button, mashing the attack button will grant you combos to unleash power attacks on your enemies.  As you play through you can spend points to unlock new combos, which while it’s a fun idea, you can achieve the same thing with if you just repeatedly mash the attack button.  It’s fun to try the new combos, but the AI is so mindless that they don’t really pose any sort of a challenge. In my opinion the strongest part of AeternoBlade is the boss fights.  In certain boss fights built to make you utilize some of the time bending and rewinding mechanics, you can just button mash the attack button and slash your way to victory.  But some boss fights that you’ll encounter on your journey are genuinely fantastic, learning their goofy attack patterns and double jumping out of the way at just the right time was a blast. In AeternoBlade you have different special mechanics the ability to rewind time regaining your health and giving you the option to replay a difficult area, however it only gives you a very small amount of health.  Which at that point you mine as well restart from on of the many closest check points. Another time mechanic gives you the ability to rewind time but allowing you to be unaffected by the time shift, think very low-budget braid.  Later in the game they did introduce some clever twists, in a certain level demons attack you while you used you time shifting mechanic making you much more conservative with its use. AeternoBlade feels like it’s trying to find its own identity, utilizing too many different game mechanics at once and not mastering any of them.  At times I feel the game would have been stronger if it was just a hack n slash metroidvania, minus all the time bending behavior. When I first jumped into AeternoBlade I didn’t like it at all, with janky time bending mechanics, dull ai, and uncreative environmental puzzles there certainly leaves a lot to be desired.  However, over time this messy hack n slash sort of grows on you, even the art style is nostalgic to earlier 3d titles.  Eventually learning my double jump, which made the boss fights even more fun, it made playing AeternoBlade a little more like comfort food.  While it is not a great game and is certainly not for everyone.  Some gamers will certainly appreciate this sort of slasher… Be sure to watch my video review at YouTube channel TheFlannelFox",TheFlannelFox,"Feb  2, 2018",AeternoBlade,Switch
664,7,"Un juego indie tal y como se entiende: con ideas interesantes, pero una implementación en gráficos y mecánicas deficientes, aunque no por ello lo hacen poco disfrutable.Aeternoblade 2, al igual que el 1, es un juego de metroidvania de tipo castlevania. Dentro del actualmente prolífico genero de los metroidvanias hay dos vertientes: los juegos que buscan perfeccionar la formula ya establecida, y aquellos que buscan innovar dentro del genero. Aeternoblade es una saga que entra en el segundo grupo, incluyendo un sistema de combate a lo beat'em up lleno de combos que podemos ir mejorando y desbloqueando nuevos con la experiencia obtenida de los enemigos derrotados en combate mientras exploramos los mapeados. Francamente, no soy especialmente fan de esto, igual que no lo soy de los beat'em ups, pero hay que reconocerle la originalidad y el esfuerzo puesto en ello.La historia del juego es especialmente interesante, acerca de la manipulación del tiempo, pero realmente muy bien hilada, y es una de las razones para jugar a este, aunque por desgracia, la narración de la misma esta muy mal llevada, en escenas bastante ortopédicas y muchas veces dejandote rellenar huecos de guión. Eso sí, recomiendo antes jugar al aeternoblade 1 ya que si no muchas cosas no tienen sentido, juego que es tan bueno o incluso mejor que este, y para el cual se aplica todo lo dicho hasta ahora.Por lo demás, el juego es un metroidvania en el que iremos explorando escenarios, los cuales se abrirán más a nosotros conforme consigamos habilidades a lo largo del juego. Tenemos al igual que en el primero la capacidad de manipular el tiempo, mecánica fundamental para resolver puzzles y avanzar por los escenarios, además de ser útil en combates. Además de la capacidad de retroceder en el tiempo como en la primera parte, en esta entrega podremos controlar temporalmente a otros dos protagonistas cuyas habilidades temporales acabaremos obteniendo: la habilidad de parar el tiempo, y la habilidad de crear líneas paralelas de tiempo (esta habilidad es difícil de explicar...). Todas estas habilidades dan juego al segundo foco de este metroidvania, que además de la acción, son los puzzles.Se incluye también una mecánica que recuerda a los templos de Zelda BoW, que son los templos, teniendo en cada punto de guardado una pequeña prueba que puede ser bien un reto de sala puzzle o un reto de combate, con una recompensa al mismo, y que son realmente ingeniosos.En esta entrega se incluyen también algunos combates en 3D, cosa que el original carecía. Por suerte no son muchos ya que son bastante menos órganicos que los combates en 2D...Otro aspecto en que supera por mucho al original es la duración del juego, sobrepasando fácilmente las 20 horas (lo cual esta muy por encima de muchos juegos del género). Por desgracia, el juego no introduce las suficientes mecánicas nuevas para mantenerse entretenido durante tantas horas, exceptuando los puzzles y los jefes (los finales son realmente épicos para un juego de estas características).El apartado gráfico, igual que en el primer juego, es... realmente no su mejor punto. El juego opta por el 3D a pesar de ser mayormente un metroidvania en 2D. Los diseños de escenarios son pasables, pero los enemigos y personajes están un poco exentos de carisma desde un punto de vida artístico. En realidad en personajes y enemigos el diseño es similar al bloodstained (donde esta impresión también se recoge de muchos enemigos) pero varios niveles de calidad por debajo. Eso sí, el juego es estable exceptuando alguna zona esporádica en cuanto a fps. En resumen, un buen juego para los amantes del genero si puedes pasar por alto sus aspectos negativos. Eso sí, jugad primero al 1, que además suele estar de oferta cada dos por tres por precios bastante irrisorios, que además de tener un fuerte componente el lore y la historia del mismo para entender este, os servirá para saber si continuar o no jugando la saga.",Sunshadow87,"Jun 17, 2020",AeternoBlade II,Switch

667,8,"If you’re looking for a brief overview though, then this game starts with the main protagonist and heroine of the first game, Freyja, as she discovers the fates of time and space are in danger of being destroyed by a cataclysmic event. Embarking on a journey to stop this catastrophe from happening, Freyja is joined by two other co-patriots, Bernard and Felix and the three of them set forth to shift the sands of time and manipulate the world around them in order to save the planet from an impending doom; something perhaps humanity could embark on with today’s current climates.The gameplay itself is made up of a number of elements and components, but for the most part it runs along the lines of a 2D, hack and slash, platformer. However, it also contains elements of a Metroidvania style of play with its points of exploration, combat moves and abilities and a series of puzzles across a number of varying environments. At various points within the game, you switch between each of the three characters, producing a variance in the combat style of its hack and slash formula, plus also change your perspective from 2D to a third-dimensional, over-the-shoulder view when up against the games’ many boss fights or find yourself within the midst of a large-scale battle. This creates a number of differing play-styles within the game; preventing it from staleness and providing a good level of fun as you play through it.Although primarily a side-scrolling, hack and slash title, the combat system takes advantage of three different move systems, as well as a variety of a weapon styles. You have heavy, light and aerial attacks, special abilities, the power to bend and adjust time and a dodge mechanic, called flash. Each of the three characters also posses varying styles of weapons, from light swords to whip-style, metroidvania, combat skills; all of which can be upgraded through a series of trees with the collection of orbs from successful mission completions. It brings a role-playing element to the game to keep you further invested into its gameplay, as well as bring some clever implementations of move styles and abilities.Once equipped with the power of the AeternoBlade, you can alter the physics of time through rewinding, creating mirror images and freezing it still. It’s a concept that is vital to certain elements of the game, namely in some puzzle solving and level traversing. For instance, I needed to get to an out-of-reach ledge, but my jump ability just could not reach it. I then flung an enemy into the air, froze time and simply jumped onto his stasis form and onto the ledge that I could not reach. It’s a genius level of design and one that makes you feel accomplished in the amount of moves you can pull off.It’s a mechanic that needs to be mastered and upgraded, as the enemies within the game spike quite early on. This presents a challenging game, but also one that still feels fair and never really frustrates. With its shifting viewpoints, exploration and exciting combat, this is a title that I had, and am still having, a lot of fun with. It plays in a similar fashion to the first game and holds many similarities in both its look and style, but this sequel is a much more refined experience, with some interesting level designs, pleasing visuals and smoother frame-rates and animations. However, it’s voice-over work is quite laughable, bordering on the level of being cheesy and a few of its elements do present the overall feel of a AA title, or a B-movie, which I found to be a more accurate description in how it feels.Its story is largely meaningless, moreso if you’ve not played the first game and its characters are complete strangers if you’ve entered the story from this title; but this doesn’t detract it from being a very enjoyable game to play through. Its levels are interesting, combat is satisfying and its overall look is pleasing. It lacks in some elements of presentation, yet provides a level of gameplay that just feels like good, old-fashioned fun; something that is missing from a lot of triple-A games these days. The musical score also matches the drama of the on-screen action, producing a B-movie blockbuster that’s simply irrsistable to play through.",Ookasora,"Oct 20, 2019",AeternoBlade II,Switch
668,8,"For what it is, AternoBlade II is not a bad game. However, this does mean it is far from perfect and does have its share of downfalls. It’s a hack n slash puzzle platformer title developed by Corecell Technology and published by PQube. The story is simple – an all-out war for universal power. Prevent the bad guys from securing an artefact that will give them complete control. Simple enough and easy to follow. My interest in the story did come and go, the biggest draw was actually AeternoBlade’s combat. The combat is just what you would expect from a hack n slash. But, that is what makes it so endearing, picking up a controller and mindlessly cutting down enemies makes a nice change of pace from having to count your ammo and think about your next attack.In terms of fluidity combat wise the game is sound, combat flows well, and it doesn’t feel blocky. Earn rewards through Norns memorials – enter the Enigmata and complete a trial to get some items to help you on this adventure. Similar to Norns memorials, you will save your progress at a Norns, and it will also serve as a checkpoint for the level. You will return either here upon death or you can go back to the start of the area if you so wish. You’re not limited to just one character on this journey, experience the slicing and dicing Freyja, Felix and Bernard, each catering to a different play style. However, the majority of the game is played as a side scroller. Not that this is a bad thing since the third-person perspective sections of the game could do with a bit of work. The camera becomes your enemy when you have a wider range of movement. While the characters may look good, it soon becomes infuriating to watch as they speak. The lips and sound are so out of sync sometimes that I actually lose track of who is speaking. However, this isn’t a constant problem, more it comes and goes. Most games in the hack n slash genre involve mindless button basing – a sure-fire way to ensure victory. That works in AeternoBlade II during the levels (for the most part) but slamming the buttons in a boss battle is a good way to end up six feet under. Throughout the game, you will earn new abilities such as the time paradox ability. Essentially you create a clone to copy your actions after you’ve done them, you have the gift of time, use it wisely. Gifts like this come in handy against bosses and solving puzzles. Clearly, this game decided the bosses should be what makes the game challenging, it can be easy reaching a boss – whole other story when fighting them. As a major fan of the Souls series, I can get on board with tough boss fights. In fact, they are quite well designed and versatile in AeternoBlade II, the developer did well. Overall, the game is an enjoyable experience and is worth playing whether or are a previous fan or not. It may have its faults such as the animations and dodgy camera angles, but it makes up for that with it’s fun combat and good puzzles.",Sora13north,"Oct 21, 2019",AeternoBlade II,Switch
669,9,"Gameplay is a mix of action packed battles, metroidvania style exploration and puzzle solving, traversing a variety of environments, battling monsters and bosses as you seek to save the universe from destruction, switching between the three characters at various points in the story, moving back and forth between the different locations to open up new paths, solve previous puzzles and find hidden treasures.The game uses a mix of side scrolling and over the shoulder camera perspectives, the majority of gameplay takes place in the side scrolling view, with boss battles and large scale battles using the third person camera, there is also quick time events scattered throughout various parts of the story. When the player enters a room they may be “locked in”, this is where they are will face waves of enemies that will attack the player, once all enemies have been defeated the player may then progress.The combat system utilizes a mixture of three types attack, a special skill, powerful time bending abilities and a mechanic called flash, a dash skill that allows the player to avoid attacks with each use having to cool down. Each of the three characters can upgrade their skills using orbs collected from defeated enemies, completing missions and as rewards, the orbs can also be used to purchase items in the shop, unlock relics and level up character stats.Speaking of items and relics, the items that the player can use include potions, temporary boosts and exploration aids, the relics offer stat boosts that can be set into custom loadouts for each player, the stat boosts can be used to either increase a characters strengths or offset a characters weaknesses, this gives an additional level of depth to the way the player can customize their experience to fit their own play style.Since the game uses a metroidvania approach to the progression of the story there are points throughout the world where the player can save, manage relics, items, teleport and take on special challenges using the time shifting skills. Now with the details of gameplay out of the way it is time to talk about the downsides of AeternoBlade II.The 3D movement is a whole other issue, the camera seems to fight against the player while trying to control it, moving while trying to avoid attacks can obscure the players view, this is most prevalent during large scale battles against several enemies and boss battles, the camera can go out of bounds when too close to a wall which is a nuisance, one upside to the over the shoulder camera is the ability to lock onto the enemies, offsetting some of the camera difficulties.Controls for combat and movement are solid, with fluidity to them as the battles go on, there is a very little input lag when executing combo attacks and using the various skills, there can be some trouble during boss fights however as there is slowdown while playing in handheld mode, this is something that the developers are working on so hopefully it will be fixed in the near future.Visually AeternoBlade II is aesthetically pleasing, while not at the same resolution as the PS4 version the game still looks good on Nintendo Switch, the overall look is a mix between fantasy and anime, for an indie title it is very well polished, the environments have a lot of grandeur to them, the monsters and cast of characters are expertly animated, having a natural look to movement and are well designed with a lot of personality to them.The sound is a mixed bag, the soundtrack is done well with suspenseful atmospheric string based compositions, fantasy styled orchestral pieces and an opening piano theme with soft vocals layered over it. The sound effects used are effective with the clashing of blades having a nice impact during combat, voice acting is difficult to judge, again, being an independent release the quality of voice cast isn’t what you would expect from a big budget title but I feel it has its own charm to it.Overall, I enjoyed my time playing AeternoBlade II, there are flaws with the game but they aren’t significant enough for me to say the game isn’t worth playing, the camera issues take a little getting used to and will hopefully be addressed with an upcoming patch, the difficulty curve did have a level of frustration to it, but it wasn’t impossible and the lack of feedback through vibration/collision detection flaws did pull me out of the experience but I don’t see it as a deal breaker.",Hooray,"Oct 20, 2019",AeternoBlade II,Switch
670,8,"In the first stages of the game, you will get to try out some of the different fighting styles as it throws you directly into the action. These fights aren’t too hard, but give you a good mix of what to expect. Since the game has both 2D and 3D sections during the fight sequences, you end up getting to fight through both styles before leaving the first area. The attack moves remain the same regardless of the view style, but it was handy that there is a lock-on feature for the sequences that play out in 3D.The majority of the game is moving through various 2.5D platforming style sections that could be as easy as running through an empty and flat area up to some very intense platforming that will require the use of time power and skill. These aren’t optional areas either, so be prepared for some difficult moments in the platforming arena. The first area that really tripped me up had me jumping on the head of these skull enemies that are only solidified when you pause time, which only lasts for a few seconds so you have to time it with the also moving platforms; not to mention the enemy that only moves while time power is in use and can’t be killed, but blows up when touched causing a knockback even if you are mid-jump.As far as the puzzle sections go, these are mostly optional. There are a few puzzle-like areas where you will need to use time powers in a specific way to proceed, but most of the puzzle areas are in the sections known as “Enigma,” which there is a new one at every single checkpoint. Sometimes you could go in and it would just be a free win, but these challenge rooms could get really difficult really fast, but they always have a relic or prize of kind at the end.Back to focusing on the fighting in the game. There is actually a LOT more fighting than I anticipated, but it is manageable as you collect yellow orbs per death and quest completion. These orbs let you power up your character and each attack, allowing you to make the attacks you use most more powerful first and then build from there. The relics you have been collecting can be equipped and leveled up with their own point counter, so the more of them you collect the wider variety of options you have to choose from. This set up allows players to make their character powerful in the areas that suit their fighting style best. My suggestion is to max out your in-air attack combo because it is a punishing attack sequence that can be abused to win fights.If there is a fight that is too difficult for you, regardless if it is a boss or a regular fight, they do offer a chance to go to an easier difficulty. This is handy because the fights are actually pretty intense and take a long time to get the health bar down in the beginning, but if you do the difficulty decrease once or twice they are faster to get through. I didn’t see a difference in the actual fight, but I took less damage per hit and did more damage per attack.They do a good job giving off a variety of enemy types and plenty of visual cues on what different things mean when it comes to using the time powers, but the enemies were pretty basic looking and rather generic. Overall, very cartoony and simplistic.I want to praise the music choice for the game and the general sound effects used. Both of these aspects were well done and very fitting, especially the fight music energy coming from something that wasn’t a rock-style song like we hear all the time these days. However, the voice acting is just horrible! There were a couple of actors that did a decent job, but almost every cutscene was just annoying to listen to since everybody pronounced names however they wanted, giving no consistencyIf you like to explore all of the areas of a game and see everything it is hiding, they give a percentage meter on how much of a map has been explored. Given that there are multiple maps, full of hidden collectibles and enemies, there is plenty to explore. There is also the relics that can be collected by completing every Enigma room, which can be done on the first go, but likely some will be passed up. So, I would say there is some reason to go back through the game, but overall the story and journey would be the same.In short, the voice acting, writing, and storytelling could all have been better. There were a lot of questionable lines that just took a moment that could have been powerful or impactful, but thanks to the line being written poorly and then acted out poorly, it just came off weak or laughable. This didn’t help me want to complete the game for the purpose of the story, but rather just the fact that I enjoyed the gameplay itself.AeternoBlade II is definitely a step up from their first game and it is a lot of fun to play! I enjoyed how difficult it was in all the aspects it focuses on, action, puzzle, and platforming, as well as just keeping me wondering what challenge lied ahead. Worth playing, if you can handle the issues with the storytelling.",Terex,"Oct 20, 2019",AeternoBlade II,Switch
671,8,"The story is an afterthought in AeternoBlade II as players go through the motions of meeting new characters and switching characters as soon as they get the hang of a set of abilities. It gets frustrating because they each have different weapon types, so you need to adjust playstyles on the fly, but things do end up become more straightforward after the first opening act and a few boss battles. However, whether a player sticks around to see this side of the game is another story. What saves the game is its decent combat that is as repetitive and mindless as you might assume it is, but it responsive where it counts. Sure the enemies are pretty much the same ones faced in AeternoBlade, but they are fun to take out. The game’s combat takes some getting used to, though, because some enemies aren’t staggered by your attacks and will swing their swords no matter how much damage you’re unleashing on them. It creates some frustrating situations, but it still manages to be satisfying. That said, using the time-warping abilities was never my go-to strategy for taking random grunts out. However, I did make it a point to use them during boss battles, which are the highlight of the entire game, well the ones that can’t be cheesed through at least. If you die multiple times during a boss encounter, the game will offer a lower difficulty for that area, which is an excellent option to have. There are also enemies who can only be defeated using the time abilities, but they were extremely annoying. Gameplay has multiple modes as it switches between 2D action to third-person action to puzzle platformer. It makes you wish the developer spent time perfecting one of these genres because you’ll switch randomly during gameplay and it never feels right. There were times when I just got out of a challenging fight, and then the next room contained a save point with a puzzle that slowed things down. Some puzzles are optional, but they contain powerups that are useful, so you pretty much have to do them. Puzzles in the game sometime require you to use the powers of the respective character. These get pretty challenging and ended up being what I would have preferred the entire game be. The third-person mode is just strange and shouldn’t be in the game. It’s unusual for some encounters, but the camera and lock-on never seem to work correctly during bosses, and it does nothing to the enjoyment of the game. I’ll also add that there are quick-time events in the game where if you miss a button press, its an automatic death, but you get to retry without any real consequence.",T-rat,"Oct 21, 2019",AeternoBlade II,Switch
672,8,"The core gameplay itself follows the tried and tested Metroidvania formula, with 2D side-scrolling, and an on-rails experience with a mostly pre-determined route of travel. However, it doesn’t stop there. Every now and then, sometimes jarringly, it switches to a 3rd person view for boss battles, which forces you to approach things in a very different way. I mostly liked this experience to mix-up the styles, but with fixed camera positions, it felt like I was playing early Resident Evil (not in a good way….arghhmmmmm STARS). There were some really wonderful side-scrolling elements I loved, with the 3D terrain revolving as you travel up a winding staircase for example, even though the route is on-rails it was very well done, and added a depth to the scenery. There are three playable characters and each one has their own unique connection to how they wield their weapons and utilise the time-manipulation powers in-game. For example, you can quickly skip forward in time with one character to dodge an onslaught in battle. For another character, you can freeze time for everyone else, and then give your enemies a good whack in their helpless states. For the third you can enter a realm of time where you can lock in 20 seconds of movement with your character, then go and do something else in real-time, which is great for activating switches to open doors that would otherwise require two people. I think this has been implemented well and keeps the layers of puzzles fresh and at times really challenging throughout the game. Often you can see a puzzling aspect to the level that you know has to be performed by another character, challenging you to return.",BEnenema,"Oct 21, 2019",AeternoBlade II,Switch

The jump mechanic is off, there would be times I clearly landed on a ledge, only to fall off of it. The camera during boss battles is cumbersome and clunky. The time travel mechanics are poorly explained and confusing to use. I played about 5 hours of it before I just couldn’t take it anymore and uninstalled it.

675,5,"This game is strange. It is a literal remake of Quest 64. It carries over the story, battle system, item system and roughly the map layout from Quest 64. The only difference is the new ability to capture and summon monsters. The graphics look like canned assets and generally have a “mobile game” feel to them, lacking the warm charm of Quest 64.Another downside is the in-game menu. Finding it and navigating it is a puzzle in and of itself. And I could never figure out how to change the camera system. The layout of buttons is very strange indeed, with L and R opening different menus, and options being tied to particular face buttons and the A button being used to close menus. It’s all just very odd. “X” looks like it would change the camera but it doesn’t appear to do anything. Same with the options in the menu. Despite all this I am enjoying it as a fan of Quest 64 and for its simplicity.",stardusty,"May 30, 2022",Aeternum Quest,Switch

You can play a game with poor graphics happily if the playability is reasonable, but this game has the worst frame rate of any game I’ve played in the past 20 years. In fact, ever. Imagine running GTA V on an Intel Atom. That’s what frame rate you get. Unforgivable on a console game.This is an embarrassing effort from the game producer, and embarrassing from Nintendo that they actually put this game on their list.

682,4,"Look, I don't want to mince words: its way too buggy. There's no excuse to release a game with this much random slowdown/lag, freezes, menu glitches, and control glitches. They are patching them which is nice, but like... I didn't even get it when it first came out and I'm still struggling with all these bugs. I thought it was just the switch port was botched, but reading around it looks like it's like this on multiple platforms. The writing is pretty solid, but drags unnecessarily in parts. Also, I know the game is set in hell, but pick a tone. It feels like they are going for a kind of Grim Fandango deal, melancholic but humorous, But then other times, things are said or done that are a bit whiplash inducing, and it's just not executed well enough for it to feel... ""all on the same page"", so to speak. Graphics are simple but serviceable, the art direction is definitely holding up the slack. That said, there are some areas that feel a bit barren (yes even for hell) and could have used a bit more love. That said, the areas with top design are a wonder to behold, even if the kind of low-tier graphics hold it back a bit. Mechanics are alright. Walk speed is both too slow *and* too fast. When nothing is being said and you have to cross a decent distance it's *agonizingly* slow, but when people *are* talking, you regularly have to stop walking or you'll end up having them skip parts of their conversation really jarringly. Dialogue system is fun but can feel a tad surface level at times, like you're not really affecting much with what you choose. If this were a smooth running, bugless experience, I'd likely have given it an 7 or higher, maybe an 8. But... it's not. The bugs are bad enough that I am too frustrated to actually *finish* the game. A game this simple graphically and mechanically has no excuse to be chugging this hard this often, and *super* doesn't have any excuse to be *crashing.* It hurts me to rate it this low, as I can tell this is a passion project with some real love behind it, but... I don't think I could ever recommend this in good conscience to someone. My only hope is X months from me posting this they've fixed it and optimized it properly, but as far as for me, the damage is done.",redgamehunter,"Aug 31, 2020",Afterparty,Switch
683,5,"I know some people I’ve talked to found it underwhelming compared to Night School’s other game Oxenfree, but I haven’t played it (I did download it on my PS5 a few days ago) so I went into Afterparty with nothing to compare it to. I figured it would give me a different perspective. Honestly what really made me interested in the game was the voice cast, I love Ashly Burch and Dave Fennoy and it was on only $20 on the eShop so I figured why not. Story wise I loved the plot (*SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON*): Two best friends have died shortly after graduating college, they don’t know how and they’re shocked to find out that they must have been bad people because they end up in hell. There is one way they can get back to the land of the living: Out drink the devil himself and he’ll let them go, but in order to challenge him they’ll need two out of three seals from the other monarchs of hell. I love this story because it’s on par with a lot of other indie game stories where they sound weird and make no sense on paper, but when you actually play it, it is really engaging. The main characters are fine, just fine. I feel like we’ve seen these types of characters a dozen times before and I didn’t think they will be that memorable to me. One positive I will say about them is that they do feel real. If you have ever once had doubts about where your life is heading or if you have some serious unresolved family issues then you can find yourself relating to them. Although if I had to pick I liked Lola more just because she was more sarcastic and those characters are always fun. My favorite character was their personal demon Sister Mary Wormhorn who is delightfully annoying. Erin Yvette (who is so underrated and deserves more video game roles) is so over the top with dialogue and I mean that in the best way. Wormhorn does everything she can to annoy Milo and Lola and sew friction between them and to judge you on every major decision you make regardless of what it is. She is so enthused to do so because it is literally her job as a personal demon. The design for hell does not really stand out and looks pretty generic. It feels more like the slums of neon lighted city. The taxi segments where Sam drives on lava is cool, but that is about it. Speaking of the landscape be prepared for some backtracking and it can get old. It doesn’t help that there are a bunch of dialogue between our two protagonist that overtime feels like the same conversations just worded differently. Skipping the dialogue would have been nice, but alas. The art style is nice at least, but it could have used a little more polish and sometimes the game would lag. Which made the backtracking feel even longer. As far as choices go they don’t matter as much as they should. The drinking is one of the mechanics. Sometimes you need to drink in order to get past some obstacles, but they mainly give you a third dialogue option, but they aren’t used to unlock a secret third route, they are mostly just jokes. Story choices like “how should we help this person” always lead to the same ending no matter what you pick so it doesn’t mean as much. SPOILER warning agin: It turns out Satan has a drinking problem and his siblings stage a surprise intervention for him. This is where the two different endings come into play. If you win the drinking game his family gives up on him and he passes out because of his excessive drinking. Sure they get to be alive again which should be the good ending. Then if you give up on the drinking game and stay in hell Milo and/or Lola get fancy new jobs, Satan is hinted to have gotten a support system and Sam finds another way to get them out of hell. So Ironically when you stay in hell everybody gets what they want. If there is no real good or bad ending then what is the point of another play through? That last sentence sums up my thoughts. Afterparty is an ok time. It has its funny moments and the mini games like the dance offs, beer pong, and the drinking game. If you just want something quick and easy and cheap to play then go ahead, I don’t regret playing it, but just like any party you have to know when to call it a night.",Hill417,"Nov 10, 2021",Afterparty,Switch

No sólo nos ofrecerá la posibilidad de formar parte de ella, sino que nos dejará pensando en qué ocurrirá incluso al apagar la consola. A través de una sencillez gráfica y de controles, se crea una adictiva, emocionante y sorprendente aventura adulta. Cuenta con detalles brillantes en dos dimensiones, muy bien dibujados, y con personajes a los que será muy sencillo cogerles cariño. Sus continuos homenajes y la capacidad para ofrecer el mejor humor la convierten en una propuesta que roza la perfección. No faltan las críticas hacia temas controvertidos, expresadas de una manera directa, efectiva y divertida. Su final sobrecogedor será el resultado de una reflexión sobre la religión, la calidad de los productos, la moralidad y el consumo de animales, cuestiones actuales que deberían tener un mayor peso en la cultura. Estemos a favor o en contra, no estará de más ver el mundo desde los ojos de una niña un tanto excéntrica. Los puzles sencillos dejan todo el protagonismo a su historia. Aunque es gratificante resolverlos, la mayor diversión llegará al ir descubriendo nuevos datos de sus personajes y al crear la religión. Es más que justo, ya que no es habitual encontrar argumentos tan originales en un sector donde ya está todo creado. Dispuesto a hacer las delicias de principiantes y veteranos en el género, ofrece un sistema de ayuda de la mano del propio Sandro. Este personaje, clave en la aventura, no sólo nos ofrecerá un desplazamiento más rápido, sino que nos otorgará las pistas necesarias en caso de atascarnos. En definitiva, Agatha Knife podría estar dentro de un listado de juegos que hay que probar, al menos, una vez en la vida. Nos llevará a conocer el llamado ‘Universo Psychotic’ de Mango Protocol y a querer saber más sobre la historia de Nika, contada en el primer juego. Completarlo nos llevará únicamente un par de tardes, gracias en parte a esos puzles poco enrevesados y a los cortos tiempos de carga (marcados con los semáforos de las calles). Sin embargo, como ya hemos comentado, quedará guardado en la memoria para siempre. Se crea, así, una correcta relación calidad-precio. Como elementos negativos, quizás su jugabilidad lineal no convenza a todo el mundo. La monotonía puede apoderarse de la aventura en algunos momentos y, si no aceptamos que la historia está por encima de la jugabilidad, puede llegar a decepcionar.",consolaytablero,"May  2, 2018",Agatha Knife,Switch

I'm not sure if the sensors are just invisible, or if the game forgets to check if you've made them emerge before checking to see if you've pointed them in the right direction. There's also decent amount of backtracking involved, especially in Chapter 5, which can be tedious. If you like the puzzle style of The Room or Myst, but the lowbrow humor of Space Quest or Monkey Island, this is a decent endeavor.

701,7,"It's easy to pigeonhole ""Agent A"" as yet another bland point-and-click adventure for smartphones. Aside from the nicer than average graphics, it sure looks like one of those hidden objects casual clickers with escape-the-room situations and fidgety puzzles. And indeed, this game is by no means short on fidgeting and room escaping–but it's also a competently made, charmingly designed adventure that strikes a good balance between being too easy and frustrating. Its tongue-in-cheek 1960s spy story tone is perfectly delivered by the nice, clean graphics, that go a long way towards making the game a pleasure to interact with. Usually, hiding essential items behind pieces of scenery feels lazy. In this game, the graphics is clean enough to make them feel like legitimate puzzles. Pity about the terrible grammar in the text, that's about the only sloppy part of the game. It would have been so easy to hire someone to fix the punctuation. But that shortcoming aside, Agent A is a good enough casual game to appeal to dedicated gamers, and probably a perfect family adventure to play with pre-teens. Seriously, for a game that's often on sale at 1 buck on the eShop, you cannot ask more from Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise.

However, double tap feels unreliable so I ended up using B button to go back. Game has a fun little story and each puzzle feels new and interesting. One big annoying factor is sometimes you have to go back and forth a lot which can get tedious, especially given no fast travel between scenes so. Superb game for its price if you enjoy puzzle games. If you manage to get it on sale, it’s a steal!

In other games, yes, but I don't think they would have worked in this one.It's designed in such a way that it's not difficult to remember where you saw the thing where this thing I just picked up works. It's not the longest game. I pretty much played it in one session. Took me around 5 hours without walkthroughs. I'm not sure if it could have used an extra chapter or if that would have made it outstay its welcome. Even though it's a totally different kind of game.

713,4,"Two major problems:1. Too many of the puzzles are simply about remembering strings of numbers. And that's just lazy and boring. The mechanical puzzles are nice, but few, and at a beginner's level.2. No map with teleportation between rooms. And this game is in dire need of one. I made a mental note of a puzzle with a bird in chapter five: an otherwise easy challenge that becomes infuriating because of the constant back-and-forth. Add to this the ""smooth"" transitions between areas and you find yourself performing a chore, not a challenge.The art is fine, though. It may not have the daring of Day of the Tentacle or Sam and Max: Hit the Road, but a similar confidence in how it twists trees, rocks and buildings in a consistent style.Too bad, then, that Agent A's personality makes little sense. His comments often try to mimic a suave 1960s movie sleuth, but they often spill over into those of an overexcited TikTok influencer, especially so when the sentences lack punctuation marks. (""Boy Havok must pay well"" is an example.)So, a game where most effort (and/or skill) went into the esthetics, while the actual gameplay as a whole is rather disappointing and sometimes frustrating.",I_C_Saltzberg,"Feb 20, 2023",Agent A: A Puzzle In Disguise,Switch
714,9,"If your a switch owner and you have stumbled upon this game and came to metacritic like me only to find no reviews of any kind then let me help your decision with this. I have played through the story mode with 2 of the 4 different mages and have played for about 4-5 hours with a another player on my console plugged into a tv. Here is what this game is to its core its a game about mages where you venture through different levels, some with bosses some without bosses there is 4 playable mage classes with them having a unique skill tree, and spells. As you might have wondered about couch co-op yes there is couch co op! You can have up to 4 players at the same time! With the level design stripped down it's fairly nothing more than a straight line or some bends in a path or road. There are unique monsters, different weapons, health items that drop, mana potions to restore mana, and gold/gems. There are different shops that unlock as you progress offering a upgrade in weapons. There are also different difficulty levels that you can play on. Newbie level does not reward players with achievements but if you are looking to just wreck havoc as a mage for fun or had a long day and need to unwind and kill monsters it's still fun and some monsters in later stages can be a challenge sometimes. I have tried varying challenge levels for at least the first 7 stages and if you are a gamer who enjoys being tested to the limits you will be able to be tested on the highest challenge level. The combat is pretty simple you have 2 spells to start out with and you can upgrade them into higher skill levels for example Lighting 1 - lightning 1-2 - lightning 2 the game in my opinion is a better version of Nine Parchments. If you want to get lost in a rpg type game without braking the bank this is the game for you.

716,8,"A nostalgic side-scrolling adventure, meets metroidvania, that hits almost all the high notes. Reminiscent of the spectacular Wonderboy games of the past, Aggelos brings a tidy package that joyfully blends the retro with the modern to provide a well-rounded and often challenging adventure.Feeling like you are stepping back in time has become somewhat of a normality in modern day Indie gaming, and my time with Aggelos was no different. Not to say this was unwelcome, with Aggelos feeling as though it would have fit perfectly between the 8-bit era of the NES and the 16-bit era of the SNES. Offering a to-the-point adventure lasting approximately 6-10 hours, you will find yourself engrossed in a compact journey to save the…insert generic storyline here. Sadly, the story of Aggelos was often forgettable, with the real highlights being the gameplay and combat, the well-designed regions/dungeons, and a metroidvania search-a-thon charm that was hard to resist. Traversing the colourful overworld was always enjoyable, dodging an array of diverse enemy types that felt appropriate to their environments, while also searching high and low for hidden upgrades, hearts, and weapons, that were never quite as conveniently located as they could have been. Fortunately, a helpful NPC offering suggestions for your next course of action makes up for the annoyingly unhelpful in-game map and lack of minimap. Each new overworld zone is quite short in the grand scheme of things, maintaining a consistent feeling of progression as you move from one area to the next. Like any metroidvania, backtracking is prominent here, however a well-designed fast travel system makes this a non-issue in the later stages of the game. While there was a lot to love while playing Aggelos, there were also a few issues including an inconsistent difficulty level towards the later parts of the game, and a game-breaking bug in the Nintendo Switch version, which at the time of this review, rendered the game unfinishable. While starting out as almost deceptively easy, the third dungeon brings about a sudden spike in challenge that felt unbalanced. The music was another less than impressive component of the game, with a repetitive soundtrack that felt appropriate to the style, genre, and locales, but never exceeded my expectations for what an incredible musical score in a game could be. In general, it was difficult to not be impressed by Aggelos, considering it was put together by Storybird - a single person studio – and still holds the quality and production value of a game completed by much larger teams, and with much larger budgets. Overall, I am very happy to have played Aggelos, finding that its triumphs far outweighed any drawbacks of the experience. A sequel is more than welcome, and with a few tweeks, this series has potential to become something special. Highlights:-	Solid adventure with a strong nostalgic feel and well-integrated metroidvania gameplay.-	Enjoyable combat system that was easy to learn and master.-	Not afraid to challenge you with its wide variety of interesting enemies and bosses.-	Dungeons felt well designed and structured, including some puzzle elements. Lowlights:-	The story felt fairly generic but accomplished the goal of providing reasonable context.-	The music could be repetitive and did not stand out for the genre.-	Difficulty was inconsistent between the first and second halves of the game.-	Early version bugs in the Nintendo Switch port, rendering the game unfinishable. GossipGaymer Score: 8/10",GossipGaymer,"May  9, 2019",Aggelos,Switch

724,4,"""Agony certainly has a really bad reputation on the Switch, and it’s not completely unfounded. It looks and runs terribly, which makes navigating the confusing mazelike areas a bit frustrating. The puzzles, skill tree (which I didn’t touch upon but makes almost no difference to how the game plays), and demon possession all feel rather underwhelmingly undercooked. Despite all this, there was something there that hooked me. After the awful opening section of the game, I found myself intrigued as to what was around the next corner and how the game would progress. Underneath all its faults, there’s actually some solid ideas and aesthetic design that could have been made into something good. Should you pay €19.99 for it? No. Should you pay €1.99 for it? Probably not,… but if you’re willing to see it through, it may not end up being a complete waste of time – especially if you dive into the genuinely enjoyable Succubus Mode. It is worth noting however that the PC version of Agony Unrated looks a lot better than the Switch version, so if you are tempted then perhaps that could be an alternative option. I imagine it probably runs far better on PC too."" https://theeliteinstitute.net/2021/08/07/agony/",Elite_Institute,"Mar  5, 2022",Agony,Switch

726,10,"To start, this game is well directed with loads of good work done into characters and the comfortable flow of what they put into the gameplay style in terms of concept. Despite it being what most would call a visual novel, AI: The Somnium Files takes the concept of it to another level by putting in interactive segments that are full of humor, character, symbolism, and aesthetic while still retaining it's full value of being a ""Visual Novel"" style story and character driven game that will throw you for loops with branching paths. Like many visual novels, it's a very laid back experience and it pulls off what it's supposed to do really well while somehow still having you on your feet with highly unique and dialogue centered interactions that you wouldn't want to miss.Gameplay: Consistent, Voluntary and Detail Oriented:In most parts of the game, you're playing a social first person dialogue oriented point and click interactive novel. For the people who like design and detail, the amount of interactions you can have within these areas and scenarios is done perfectly and done well enough to keep you interested into every single detail of every frame of the game. Plus, with me personally, I had fun with just the characters dialogue and the personalities alone.You can choose to blaze through the story like a regular visual novel, or you can choose to take in the small details in the environment and take in more of the personalities of the characters that I am sure many players would grow to enjoy. There are segments that are physically interactive in the third person as you roam the Somnium (deep sleep recess of the mind), and interact with items in the room that you move in while controlling Aiba, your AI False Eyeball Companion that literally lives in your head. Explore the Somnia, interact with items, and solve puzzles. It's quite simple and the developers did it well.The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are unique and amazing, and although there are some that are ""cliche"" in scenario, the way that they are interpreted and put into the story is well done. The physically interactive segments are a really good fun new touch to what one would expect from a Spike Chunsoft ""Visual Novel"". In all fairness, it's an interactive dialogue centered game that is a rare combination of being BOTH character (in terms of interactions and personality) and story driven. I am very happy I got this game. Definitely a must buy for anyone who is looking for a laid back yet highly enjoyable mystery solving aesthetically pleasing AND YET on your toes unique experience.

My only complaint is that while the main character Kaname Date is very likeable in his own way he does often ruin the mood with out of place sexual humor, may not bother some but it happened a bit too much for me.

The writing is very well paced, all the characters are amazing in their own crackhead ways, and the mystery is captivating. Date and Aiba's relationship is hilarious, there is never a dull moment between the two whether the scene is serious or **** Mizuki and Date work so well as a ""found family"" and Mizuki END is so sweet it's tooth rotting. Pewter? Outstanding, finally a big brain character that isn't all science lingo and can't crack a joke. Even Shoko, who is absolutely horrible as a person, is a good character that serves her purpose. Mizuki's trauma is presented very well and it's obvious that heavy research was done to make sure nothing was being misrepresented. It would be a crime to not give a passing mention to the LGBT representation from Mama, Pewter, Renju, Date, and Kagami.Every route has its charms and even with one route being the cause of my nightmares for two days, I can't say there's anything negative about it. I can confidently say the Annihilation Route scared me **** and I was not prepared for any of it. As the name suggests it isn't the happiest by any stretch of the imagination but it delivers in every department. The soundtrack in Iris' somnium properly freaks you out, you get very clear insight to the past Cyclops Killings, and so much of the story starts coming together.Fans of the Zero Escape series and other Uchikoshi works (such as myself) will definitely like this absolute masterpiece and will understand just how underappreciated it is, much like all of Uchikoshi's games. Not to sound like elitist garbage but they're just too ahead of their time. I know for certain people will look back at ZE and AITSF and think ""how did we miss such incredible games?"" I know the review bombing came from some bitter Ota kinnie who's too far up his own ass to understand Iris' treatment in the game and is blinded by his loyalty to a fictional idol and not Reddit's speculation of hate on the LGBT speech Mizuki gives in Marble (which drove me to tears) but regardless of the situation, AI: The Somnium Files does not deserve any hate, from pathetic Ota kinnies or not. At this point, I'm pretty sure Uchikoshi could predict the future and wrote Ota **** around that sad lump of **** because there are too many similarities between the two. I'm not kidding, he's smart enough to put together the plotlines for the ZE trilogy and AITSF with minimal plotholes, who's to say he didn't base SHIFTing off his real life experiences? Is Kotaru Uchikoshi the second coming of God? I certainly wouldn't deny it.",BaseballRats,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

Uchikoshi never fails to amaze me with his games and his passion really shines through with this one! You can tell that a lot of work went into the creation of the game, and that’s one of the many reasons it’s such a great play.You’re guaranteed to get invested in the story, the characters, and making all kinds of theories about what’ll happen next.

749,9,"The AI somnium files is a murder mystery that has you follow the main character Date and his AI partner as you uncover the truths behind the new cyclops serial killings. You do this by going through point and click segments interacting with items in the world, talking to the people on screen, and later doing one of the core gameplay segments, psyncing (diving into someones dreams). As you do these dives, you learn that there is a branch in peoples minds where the story will diverge into different routes, this is all reasonably well maintained in a flowchart and allows for you to experience the events of a single day in different fashions. While this gameplay loop isn't very intensive and relatively simple, I feel like it combos really well making an interactive story that I was able to sit down with and enjoy while being tired. The relaxing yet intense vibes as you are constantly trying to make sense of all that is happening in this world really got me going to the point I did screw up my sleep schedule just to achieve a route ending out of sheer curiosity. Overall I loved the characters and story. Mentioning the story, I feel that it was structured very well. The mystery was well laid out, the characters all accomplished their roles very well, and it was a fun journey with just the right amount of chaos. There were some minor inconsistencies but i don't feel like those take to much from the overall experience. If I have anything to really complain about, its probably any of the action scenes. They were almost all poorly executed, extremely random, and definitely aiming at just being fan service (and the only one i actually even semi liked was one having the mc deciding if saving a life is worth the porn in his jacket). In conclusion, I give this game a 9/10 for the fact that I was hooked throughout the entire 25ish hour experience. It was a good ride that was I was able to relax with and I absolutely loved the style of writing in most cases. This game will is definitely not for everyone as its catered towards ""weebs"" but if that isn't going to phase you, I would humbly recommend giving it a shot. A-set you bet.",Terrorgod,"Feb 28, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
750,9,"AI: The Somnium Files is a Graphic Adventure with strong Visual Novel elements that places you in the role of an investigator in a futuristic police force that uses AI-augmented vision and subconscious-exploring technology (a la Inception) to solve crimes. This game's story and presentation is one of its strongest elements. It starts with a gruesome murder, and you're immediately introduced to protagonist Date (pronounced Daw-Tay), a member of a special police task force with bizarre futuristic technology, including the aforementioned Inception-esque dream technology. Date has been assigned to investigate the crime in part because he knows the victim, and the investigation will soon come to involve others in his life as well. The story is told in a manner that's very reminiscent of an anime, with the game taking place in Tokyo and characters fitting into standard anime archetypes, although they're depicted with enough depth here, and the story itself is so engrossing that it really pulls you in - the game really makes you want to learn more about this world, and discover just what could have led to such a horrifying murder. However, one of the more inventive ways the game draws you into this world is when the game has the player go into Somnium, the game's term for a person's dream state or subconscious. Here, players take control of an avatar of Date's AI companion, who must navigate the dream state to not only uncover clues to the mysteries at hand, but also possibly heal the mental trauma of the subject. During these sections of the game, things play out like a warped Graphic Adventure, where players are observing the environment, looking for clues, and using items to solve puzzles, but since this is taking place in a dream state, the logic of everything doesn't follow real-world rules, and players have to try to wrap their brain around the strange logic this presents, often with symbolism playing just as much an element as traditional storytelling. These sections are also presented in a way that limits a player's time to move around and interact in this state, forcing players to be selective about which actions to take in this limited time. I was initially wary of this gameplay element, but players can at any time simply stop moving and look around to think about what they'll do next, and the clock stops with them, meaning that feeling of being rushed isn't as much of a concern, and instead the limited time means that players will have to be sure that every action they take is one they're fairly sure will help them accomplish their goals. I really appreciated how this encouraged taking a measured, thoughtful approach to this game's mind-bending puzzles. Outside of the Somnium sections, the game plays out more like a Visual Novel, with players observing environments, having conversations with various characters, and using the protagonist's artificial eye (itself a major character in the story) to dig up information. If there was one part of the game that I felt was a bit lacking, it was this part of the game, which comprises the majority of the game. It's not bad, by any stretch, as there is some very good story conveyed through this part of the game. However, there's nothing here that compares to the puzzle-solving found in the Somnium sections, and often I found myself wondering if my choices in these sections mattered, something that never seemed in question in the Somnium sections. Graphically, this game is good, using subtle cel shading to give this game an anime-style look that fits the story. It's not perfect - the environments could do with a bit more detail and the characters' mouths not moving in time with what they're saying feels a bit off, but on the whole this game looks pretty good visually. The sound on the other hand, is pretty fantastic, and in particular I have to give credit to the voice acting in this game, which is pretty excellent. Even though the writing at times dips into the cross-cultural awkwardness that's often typical of anime localizations, the voice acting does a great job of conveying the characters' feelings and giving us a good feel for them as actual people. I really enjoyed AI: The Somnium Files, thanks to the great story and presentation, and in particular the Somnium sections of the game, which are so surreal and with such unique puzzle logic that there doesn't seem much else out there like them. It's a shame that the rest of the game's gameplay isn't quite as engaging and imaginative as these portions, but the story generally picks up the slack. Fans of Graphic Adventures, anime, and sci-fi who don't have a problem with creepy, violent imagery should consider this game a must-buy.",CaspianX,"Feb 18, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
751,10,"Having played the zero escape series I more or less knew what I was walking into... A string of escape room puzzles with an extremely complex plot and while the former was exactly as good as I expected the former was a bit of a letdown. I admit the latter part of the zero escape series (VLR-ZTD) had a hugely unfair difficulty curve but this feels like a massive over-correction. The puzzle sections feel a bit too easy.. indeed its no longer about carefully combing the environment and taking your time its about managing it. Every action in a puzzle section costs you time even walking. You can stand still if you need time to think but I found myself brute forcing these sections more often than not. I think I get what they were trying to do. Zero escape definitely had trouble conveying urgency through game play. You weren't ever solving puzzles under the gun, you had all the time in the world. So you'd have characters yelling at you to hurry but you quickly figured out there was no penalty coming. The new system... sacks interesting puzzles in favor of trying to add tension and I'm not sure I approve, I like being challenged and the puzzles just weren't doing it for me the way this director previous work has and while I enjoyed playing it I'm sort of hesitant to re-play it over 999 or VLR. That said I still wholly recommend it for its story aspect and while that too is was way more simple than I'm used to I was sort of okay with that by the end.",Raspbryl,"Feb 23, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

The story is enthralling, nearly every character is fleshed out and sympathetic, and the twists are genuinely surprising while being hinted at and foreshadowed frequently. It’s not the most traditional game ever, but I would recommend it to basically who can handle a little blood/murder. I haven’t been this emotionally involved in a game in a long time. There are some minor flaws (the switch version has some trouble playing some of the dialogue, Date’s Percy nature gets overstated and becomes a bit annoying, etc), but I’m willing to forgive them because of how thematically tight and well crafted the story is.

Let me just say, thank God I gave this game a shot because I adored this game from opening to closing credits. If you are a fan of solving murder mysteries or even crime mysteries with an amazing plot, loveable characters that are well defined and an amazingly funny story, then all I have to say is, stop what you're doing, pick up this title and PLAY THIS GAME!! You will not be disappointed. In fact, I can personally guarantee that you will not be able to put down. It's that f**king good! You will be blown away with just how much love and attention the entire team, from development to localization, gave to this project. Everyone literally put their blood, sweat, and tears into making sure that we got everything we could ever hope for in a well-polished game and it clearly shows.I know that I am repeating myself like a broken record, but that is just how damn happy I am to have played this work of art!! The plot was so well written and engaging that it kept me eager to find out what happened next. The twists and turns were just enough to keep you on your toes without becoming too convoluted or boring. And when all is said and done, I could not find a single character that I did not give any f**ks about. . . . Well, there was 1 or 2, but this is not due to poor character development. The characters were just that believable. The ending is satisfying and did not come off as a Dues Ex Machina or a mary sue. Lastly, I have to say that both voices acting in both Japanese and English were A+ grade. I actually loved the English dub and Japanese equally. This is rare as I usually only play or watch anime in Japanese only so that I can have the original context of a story as it was originally intended. But, the translation was so great that I was left grinning from ear to ear at the cleaver dialog and banter between characters. In the end, thank you, THANK YOU Uchikoshi and everyone involved in creating and releasing this gem to the masses!",lancermonna,"Feb 16, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

781,10,"Quite possibly the best VN, and certainly the best mystery-centric game I've ever had the opportunity to play. Uchikoshi's newest work (999, VLR) is also quite possibly his best, in no small part due to a more restrained focus, tighter story, greater opportunities to flesh out his cast of lovable characters, and a presentation leagues beyond any of his DS and 3DS offerings. Is the game perfect? Of course not, no game is. Some performance issues plague the game, it has crashed on my a few times (a generous autosave system prevented this from being anything beyond an annoyance) and some of the jokes didn't land quite as well as intended. However, it contains some of the best writing I've seen in any game to date, unforgettable characters, and a mystery that's still managing to worm it's way around my head.

I had never played an Uchikoshi game (well, I played an hour of 999 but that doesn’t count) but that didn’t stop me at all. As soon as I heard it was out for Switch, I bought it, and got the Day One edition with cute little stickers (One of which I slapped onto my laptop after finishing the game). The first time I got it though, the cartridge was missing, which really bummed me out. Luckily, we got the game replaced and I was so excited to play it. I stayed up way to late playing the game because it was just so good! There were times when I had to remind myself to eat because I was so engrossed in the story. It’s not a long game, it took me 4 days of playing to finish it for a total of 24 hours spent in game. While the switch was a bit slow at loading some of the bigger scenes, it’s not that big of an issue. I could feel how hard the system as trying, as it was often really hot after coming out of docked mode. That said, the story, characters, and soundtrack charmed me so much.

The humor in the game is awesome, with some easter eggs point to other games/anime, and some real world people.

796,9,For a game about solving a grizzly murder its one of the most fun visual novels out there having an amazing cast of characters and great storytelling I'd say it's a must buy for anyone into visual novels.,Nematoad,"Sep 27, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
797,9,"Unlike the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Zero Escape games, AI: The Somnium Files is a bright and fun visual novel. The characters are well-written and the plot (relative to other Uchikoshi games) is strong and without too many plot-holes. Though there often are huge tonal shifts between ""my friends are all dead"" and ""hey, look at the boobs!,"" the sheer comedy of the whiplash works in the game's favor. The humor *is* more juvenile than I normally like, yet I still howled throughout. AI suffers most in a comparison to Zero Escape when it comes to the ""puzzles"" (i.e. Somnia). These puzzles are governed by a not-too-generous time limit and some truly nonsensical dream ""logic."" Again, the nonsense ultimately works because it entertains, despite the initial frustrations of trial-and-error. But if you think you'll get to live out your anime detective fantasies, think again. The game is only non-linear in the classic Uchikoshi sense, with multiple timelines, all of which lead to a ""true"" ending. Within each puzzle for each timeline, there's only one correct solution with a tiny margin of error. Performance in handheld mode is great; it only lags a bit when you use the skip function aggressively. In docked mode, however, the adaptive resolution is downright terrible: it's almost blurry enough to confuse the characters, which — being well designed — is a hard feat to manage. Luckily, I played most of the game in handheld mode and only discovered the terrible docked performance on a lark. Caveat emptor if you want to play this on a big screen. The game's design is so haphazard and maximalist, I often thought I was having a stroke. As with most of the above shortcomings, this mess was actually charming. The game held my attention as much as — though for different reasons than — 999 and VLR. When I wasn't playing it, I was often thinking about it. If you're looking for intense and satisfying puzzles, this game has none. If you're looking to play it on your TV, this version is not recommended. But if you're looking for a visual novel overflowing with charm and humor, one with a genuinely mysterious and captivating plot, and one that you can play in your bed or while roaming, buy this game at full price. I reckon that I'll come back to it in a year or so, once I've forgotten most of the story beats.",jagajazzist,"Sep 29, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
798,10,"Take into account the game has been review-bombed. Before that it used to be a 8.2.Whether you enjoy AI depends on whether or not you usually like visual novels. Ushikoshi's style is usually hit or miss - if you dislike it, you'll have an okay experience with the game.If you like it, as I do, then you are in for a hell of a treat. I absolutely loved AI, from the characters, the music, everything. My only issue is the first moments, as it starts slowly.Otherwise, prepare yourself for this hidden gem.",HappyEndInc,"Feb  8, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
799,10,This was my first VN game and i really got into this genre thanks to this game. The Characters the story 10/10 the twist is mindblowing atleast for me its a must in my opinion. And if people have never played VN games before this will be the best entry of newcommers hands down GOTY for me. WELL DONE.,Lesh0,"Dec 27, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
800,9,"this game is absolutely amazing, the story is so good and the mystery is so engaging, give it a try!",StarsWitch,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
801,10,"Another riveting game by Uchikoshi. It has a captivating story perfect for fans of his other games. It made me laugh, cry and be intrigued by the characters and the plot until the very end. I would recommend it for anyone who likes the visual novel genre.",Pedrohso,"Oct 21, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
802,10,This is the pinnacle of VN mystery games. Probably the best one of its kind I've ever played. I do not know why it is getting review bombed but please ignore it.,Real1Gaming,"Feb  8, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
803,10,"This game is amazing. Beautiful Visual Novel with a compelling story. The story can be quite heavy and dark at times, but is also very light and easy to follow.Great characters that you can easily relate to.",animeUwU,"Dec 22, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
804,10,Great game. Compelling story with fun puzzle mechanics and a nice plot twist at the end.,vengeancemeow,"Feb  5, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
805,10,Amazing game and easily one of the highlights of 2019. One of the best Visual Novels I've ever played.,valenti,"Feb  8, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
806,10,"This game took me by surprise. I was not expecting to fall in love with the characters, plot, and gameplay. The pacing was spot on and didn't feel like it was dragging. The humor was outstanding and one of the best Ive come across in a visual novel. After playing AI, I tried playing the nonary game series but I couldn't get into it. The pacing was too slow and the story wasn't as captivating. Honestly, I think AI ruined other visual novels for me because it was that good. I look forward to seeing what else Spike Chunsoft comes up with and look forward to (hopefully) more visual novels from them.",cecechan,"Feb  8, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
807,10,Uchikoshi has done it again. Created one of the most captivating and well written stories in gaming including bad sex jokes. Zero Escape was an instant cult classic and super narratives in gaming. Ai The Somnium Files is an amazing follow up.the GOTY that will never get the attention or buzz it deserves,NenJutsu,"Sep 17, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
808,9,"This game is typical of Uchikoshi -- a mix of scifi + mystery and some sexual innuendos littered about. I really appreciated the character development in this series, although the plot wasn't as immersive as 999. The sound track is quite enjoyable and relaxing, and the voice acting was actually really good. As much as I liked the game and played it through to the end, I think the interactive ""somnium"" puzzle portions of the game weren't so enjoyable. The time limits put a lot of stress in rushing through trying to find the right path (which often require obscure logic), detracting you from the environment. It's a shame, because some of the environments are quite interesting since you're exploring a dream in the somnium. While at first it felt like it was a cheap way to add a challenge to the game, it works out with the plot.",doghairdontcare,"Nov 25, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
809,10,"An excellent game. Probably my game of the year.Best ost , best suspense,best everything",devillili,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
810,9,"I absolutely adore this game. All the characters are very well written, and the plot is filled with twists and turns that made me not stop playing until I finished it. There are a few small performance issues on Switch, but nothing major. Highly recommend to anyone who likes point and click games,  or Kotaro Uchikoshi. I bought the limited edition, and I'm glad I got it.",MarkDream35,"Feb  8, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
811,10,Uchikoshi’s games are always unique in their ideas and execution with a blend of science fiction tropes and solid writing. Fantastic work.,Sigerson317,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
812,10,"This game was awesome, hilarious, and best of all: super weird. It has an incredible story but never takes itself too seriously. The fact that people are review bombing this fantastic game is incredibly disheartening. Don't listen to the bad reviews, check this game out! It will definitely be worth your time.",BaconBiscuit,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
813,9,I loved this game. There was a lot of sex jokes but I didnt really mind it too much. It was exactly what I was looking for in terms of mind bending and the mystery was so fun to figure out. After a certain reveal I stopped playing so I could figure out how everything had played out in the other timelines. I love figuring it all out from there.,Kayender,"Feb  8, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
814,9,"AI: The Somnium Files is another great game from Kotaro Uchikoshi, writer of the Zero Escape series. This game has a lighter tone than Zero Escape and never takes itself too seriously, but you will get glimpses of the excellent psychological thriller elements that Uchikoshi is so great at portraying. This is not a gameplay focused game, just a really gripping visual novel that fans of the genre should give a chance. I Imagine this game will touch many hearts if it becomes more appreciated.",lenz,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
815,10,"This was my first Uchikoshi game and I really enjoyed it!! I've got a really terrible attention span and have not finished any game this quickly in a really long time.. I think i'm replaying it a third time? currently..  Played it on a friend's switch for about an hour and got hooked, then debated on price for about a month and i really regret not immediately buying it after honestly. Finished in a week? I'm so glad this game was suggested to me.",stellamarine,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
816,10,"Uchikoshi continues to gift us with incredibly fun thrillers featuring lovable characters and tension that keeps you going pushing through the story late into the night.  Great for fans of his other works (Zero Escape and the Infinity series) and for new fans alike, especially if you're into mystery, crime, and puzzle solving. Can't wait to see more from Mr. Uchikoshi",loveshockers,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
817,10,This game was a great time. I started it and fell in love with it. I admit that it's not for everyone but that's ok.,LunarRose,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
818,10,"This is a very genuine and funny game. It has a great mystery, interesting branching paths, and cool characters. It didn't deserve to be review bombed.",Drlemons,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
819,10,Fun mistery game with amazing characters. The puzzles are a bit of trial and error but they are still fun. Music is very good.,GfJohn,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
820,10,"Another fantastic game by the Zero Escape devs. Uchikoshi continues to knock it out of the park in writing, storytelling, and gameplay, might be one of his best yet. Highly reccomended.",Melloo,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
821,10,"Uchikoshi is my favorite developer, hands down. I went into AI: Somnium Files expecting great things, and was not disappointed. The characters are extremely lovable, the humor had me on the floor at times, and the suspense had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. This is my favorite serial killer story, and finishing it left me tearful and telling everyone I knew to play it.",reksigh,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
822,10,"AI is a fantastic story, with a lovable cast of characters and plot twists that will blow your mind. Any fan of visual novels, mystery, and thrillers will love this game.",epigz,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

827,10,"An awesome visual novel with very high production value. A great plot that kept me guessing the whole way and engaging characters. Great twist too that I really didn't see coming. Recommended for fans of Uchikoshi's other games, but also for people who love true crime, sci-fi mysteries and puzzles.",sgch,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

829,10,A truly unique experience of a game. Being a huge fan of the Zero Escape series I was a bit sceptical of the narrative of this game but after the first playthrough I realized the depth and work that was put in these characters and plot. Honestly the last 5 hours of the game were absolutely phenomenal and had me at the edge of my seat. Amazing twists! Couldn't recommend it more!,NickLibra,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

831,10,"Juego genial de un creador genial. Cuando uno piensa que es imposible que algo se acerque en calidad a Zero Escape, AI Somnium Files es de una grandísima calidad.",Sakai,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
832,10,"Easily the best game released in 2019, if not the best game released in the past few years. An excellent find for any fans of the visual novel detective mystery genre. From the mind of the man who brought us the Zero Escape series, fans will see welcome returning elements such as the timeline flowchart, however it does depart from the zero escape formula at times, with pleasing results. This game is a lot more emotionally charged than zero escape titles ever were, focusing a lot on comedic dialogue, paralleled with some deep and often heart wrenching character development moments. Make no mistake, while this game does seem to focus on emotional impact there is no shortage of clever twists and turns in the narrative, as one would expect from the genre.    well",WeedleSenpai,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

835,10,"There's proof via the waybackmachine that this game has been review bombed. Which is idiotic considering how great this game is; in no way does it deserve its artificially low rating. I both played this game and watched twitch streams of it. The engaging story, gripping plot twists, and surprisingly good characters always drew people into it. It's a VN so the gameplay may not be everyone, but the puzzles were enjoyable and contributed much to the overall mystery of the game. I did have some issue with the way too numerous pervy jokes and odd references and humor, but those were small detractors that were vastly outweighed by the game's positives. I loved being surprised at every plot twist and the final twist made perfect sense. Uchikoshi really knows how to put foreshadowing in the right places with few plot holes. And man, the English voice actors were amazing as well! Don't believe the low user score which was mostly just bot ratings instead of actual reviews. Someone was clearly butthurt.",cassiopeia2020,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
836,10,"An absolute masterpiece of a game from the mind of Kotaro Uchikoshi. An extremely well-plotted murder mystery with phenomenal characters (brought to life by equally phenomenal voice talent), incredible music, and an interesting gameplay loop of exploring dreams. Also quite possibly one of the funniest yet heartwarming games I've played in a while, with patently absurd humor spread throughout and a genuine sense of sincerity that occasionally goes intentionally full-cheesy because you know what sometimes cheese is the best. If you like good murder mysteries and fleshed out characters that can make you cry both from laughter and from feels, sometimes simultaneously, then get this game.",shedvolans,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
837,10,"This game is awesome. The story is very engaging and you can't stop playing. If you liked Nonary Games, this is your game.",Kyuuchan,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
838,10,A good combination of Adventure elements and visual novel ones with an excellent story that worth your time.,Rhizome,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
839,9,"I thoroughly enjoyed AI from beginning to the end! It gave enough Zero Escape vibes to satisfy while being a completely different game that was refreshing. It doesn't take itself seriously yet tugged heartstrings and made me shed tears. The story is intriguing enough without being overly convoluted, giving you enough hints to figure things out as you go along before hitting you the full reveal. (With shout outs to the zero escape series too!) The switch version can be pretty laggy at times which sometimes makes serious scenes feel slightly anticlimactic but the story, music and characters more than makes up for it. I enjoyed the amount of details that goes into ""optional"" things (e.g conversations that are optionals, different dialogues when investigating the same items, etc). The characters really made me care for them in a way that made me feel lonely when I finished the game. It is a great and very satisfying game to play!",Hotori,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

845,10,Uchikoshi's games are always a treat and AI: Somnium Files is no exception. The story was a gripping mystery from start to finish characters are very well written and I'm a huge fan of the character designer from his work with the fire emblem series.,aceofwar20,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
846,10,AI: The Somnium Files is one of the best visual novels i've ever played.It easily holds up to the zero escape series.The characters are a lot more complex than the review bombers say (because most of them just copy pasted one review).,flojo1797,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
847,10,A genuinely fun and moving detective thriller from the folks who brought you Zero Escape.,franklinEB,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
848,9,"I'm a big fan of Uchikoshi's previous work, so when I saw this game coming out I was chomping at the bit to get it. And believe me, I was not disappointed. A truly incredible story and characters throughout.Basically my only complaint is that it's not the most well optimized game for switch. It is still perfectly playable, but I'd recommend it for steam or ps4 first if those are options for you. But absolutely pick the game up if you can. You won't regret it.",Kevandre,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
849,10,A great game with an engaging story and beautiful art. Recommend it for anyone wanting some detective games.,Defenestration,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
850,10,The story was so enthralling that I lost sleep to keep playing and see what happened! The gameplay was unique and fun and I love Mizuki so much!,Whattawiseguy,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
851,8,"As a fan of the zero escape series, I had high hopes for this game and it delivered. The characters are interesting, the crime was solvable while still having lots of twists and turns. The art, in particular, was very good (with the exception of some animations, but I'm a nitpicker). The game kept me guessing until the very end, with fun sequences and interesting mechanics. While sometimes the somniums felt purposefully frustrating, they still, in my mind, enhanced the overall experience. My only real issue with the game is how weirdly horny it is sometimes, for no particular reason. I felt like the random references to pornography and the sexualization of some of the characters was really unnecessary and it made me really uncomfortable.",inspectorclarke,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
852,10,"I've been a fan of Uchikoshi's other games for a long time, and this game didn't disappoint! Very polished, captivating story, fun and relatable characters, and a really fresh and interesting puzzle mechanic. If you're a fan of sci-fi/mystery story-driven puzzle games, you should definitely check this game out.",MattTheAlien,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

857,10,"I just bought the game last week and the story was just so engrossing. I found myself wanting to play for a quick 30 minutes and finding myself wondering why 6 hours have passed. It's a relatively short game, it only took me ~20 hours to finish the main story and I'm contemplating trying to go back to find all the secrets in the Somnium stages. I loved all the characters and the dialogue written for them, the little spats between the main character Date and his partner Aiba, or the sassy-ness of his daughter-like roommate and the plenty of jokes within the game. The music honestly wasn't very memorable, the only really memorable song was Iris's song ""the invincible rainbow arrow"" which the singing performance is mediocre at best and at worst cringe worthy, but it grows on to the player by the end of the game. The game looks fantastic graphically however struggles a bit on the switch, there is a lot of frame drops when loading new areas and the game stops for moments to load a video/cutscene every know and then inside dialogue... which occurs fairly often. Additionally, there was a time where the game failed to load the video/cutscene for over 20 minutes, however closing the game fixed the issue, on the brightside the game frequently auto saves and you can skip most of the dialogue fairly easily. If this makes you cautious of the game, I urge you to just buy a different version of the game. I'm certain that the performance issues are unique to the switch and urge you to try the game on a different platform. Because of these performance issues I would probably have rated AI an 8 or 9, but seeing as these issues seem exclusive to the switch... and that someone just review bombed the game... I'll rate the game a 10/10.",Maxman1414,"Feb  7, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
858,10,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this game. I have played the danganronpa games and was looking for a similar experience and I couldn't be happier with ai. The gameplay is interesting and the idea of delving inside someone's mind was a cool concept. But above all else the game shines with its writing and characters the game does have a mix of both a serious and comedic tone that can at first feel a little strange but, I personally loved it I definitely recommend this game. (Also note that the game has seen a review bomb so I would honestly recommend looking up the steam reviews as they are a lot more honest rather than basing your opinions on the average user score from metacritic.)",maddiz,"Feb  6, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
859,9,"This game is the Uchikoshi we all know and love, with stellar voice acting and pretty decent visuals. What more could you ask for? Like all of his games, I only wish I could wipe my memory and start over again...",elpsycongruent,"Dec  8, 2019",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
860,10,"Don't let the review bombing fool you; if you enjoyed the Zero Escape saga, you'll love this game. The only issues on the Switch version are some loading time issues and a bit of stuttery animations later in the game, but not enough to get this kind of negative feedback. The story is great, the mystery is enthralling, and while some voice choices are a bit strange the characters are all great. The ONLY justification I can assume for such a sudden burst of negative reviews is that some dark corner of the internet got wind of the fact that the game makes a pro-LGBT statement, and the snowflakes can't take that lying down.",Soeroah,"Feb 10, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

862,10,"It took me roughly 35 hours to beat AI: The Somnium Files and it happened with tears in my eyes. And I mean that in a positive way. I see it as an evolution in terms of VNs. Not one without flaws but definitely a step forward.I wasn't too sure how this game turned out, before playing it myself. The ARG and viral marketing with A-Set aka Tesa and her Youtube channel as well as Twitter pages where excellent, yet there wasn't much information about the actual main character Date and his partner Aiba. So I dived into the game without any expectations. Where Kotaro Uchikoshis last game, the finale of the Zero Escape Saga ""Zero Time Dilemma"" felt rather depressing and left me unsatisfied with many questions unanswered, AI made it pretty clear that it is different on many levels.This time around we aren't trapped in a deadly game, instead we investigate a murder case. The victim being an old friend of us and the mother of a child, we took to us a few years ago. We are Date Kaname, a man who lost his memory six years ago and our companion is our left eye - Aiba. An artifical intelligence with her own personality, who helps us in our investigations. The interactions between the two are pure gold, not just well written but also fun. Both characters are fast to grow on ones heart. AI is a rollercoaster of feelings but light hearted in it's core, despite the sometimes gruesome murders.Gameplaywise it's similar to Zero Escape. AI alternates between sections where we talk with other characters and where we can take a look at everything in our locations like in a classic adventure and the Somnium section where we dive in someones dream to get closer to the truth. There we are controlling Aiba under a 6 minute time limit and interact with the environment to unlock the different mental locks of a person. I.e. The interactions cost time but often give a bonus like ""1/10"" which reduces the time used for the next interaction by 1/10. So activating a light switch that would usually take 10 seconds from our 6 minute time limit would now just take 1 second.The Somniums are all rather different, sometimes they are pretty creative, sometimes dull, sometimes you excactely know what to do, sometimes it's trial and error. The error though can be a lot of fun.So what did I mean by evolution? Virtues Last Reward was the first time that an Uchikoshi-game used 3D but it didn't changed anything. The VN was still as stiff and static as before, making it appear as if the decision was just to save money. It became better with Zero Time Dilemma but with AI it is not just looking decent, it also contributes to the game. Walking around in the Somnium, having cutscenes and action sequences with different angles and most importantly, being able to look around during the talking sections. The characters are sitting or standing, moving around and changing their expression depending on what is said. Sure, it's not new having different expressions but it's pretty fun talking to a character and suddenly you can see another one changing to a shocked expression and gesturing innocently.The game is incredibly fluid, looking around clicking on things, talking, fasting forward or taking a different route (which are really different and don't feature annoying repetition). AI is setting a bar here in comfort.Of course there are flaws though:- the graphics and animation are just adequate, even though the characters look pretty good- I had some crashes, not too bad since the auto save is pretty good but still, shouldn't happen- there are some instances so over the top where less would have been more- where Zero Escape had a very interesting twist and explanation for the different routes, AI is lacking that- sometimes trial and error in the Somniums and a time limit, that also limits the time to interact in the dream worldsPersonally I didn't mind the flaws really. Yes the game does not feature such extreme twists like the past Uchikoshi works but for over thirty hours I still had a ton of questions. The english dub is really, REALLY good (!), the whole concept of investigating in dream worlds is cool, the writing is great and the characters fantastic, I can recommend AI: The Somnium Files with all my heart to anyone who likes Visual Novels.",WolfStark,"Feb 11, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

871,9,"I have so much to say about this game but I’m gonna try to keep this as short as possible. First of all, I’m a huge Zero Escape fan and the ZE series has been hands down my absolute favorite video game for the past 3-4 years. No game or series or general media could bring me to as much enjoyment and emotion I felt while playing and finishing ZE or even come close to being considered my favorite. But this game totally changed that. Not only did it bring me more enjoyment and feelings than ZE, but in my opinion? Was written even better than ZE. You can definitely tell Uchikoshi learned from his previous projects and a really amazing team was brought together for this game. It has so many amazing characters. I even found myself taking a liking to Ota! I did take a point off because although this game has very strong pro-LGBT dialogue, I feel like the character representation could be way better. I wish Mama hadn’t been a caricature of a trans woman. Not to mention the ableism we see later in the game. That is definitely something that needs to be improved. Even so, it’s a definite must play. It really gets you thinking. I’d say this is one of those games you never forget.

874,9,"Ai: The Somnium Files has heart — and lots of it. From its carefully crafted plot to its stellar voice acting, this game's best elements set a new standard for the visual novel genre. However, BE WARNED: If you're looking for a puzzle-based game similar to the Nonary Games trilogy, this isn't it. The ""puzzle segments"" in this game are more rooted in exploration than heavy logic — which is charming and fun in it's own way. Pros: -Gorgeous art style-Smart and engaging plot-Captivating characters-Lively humor-Solid UI-Raises the bar for English ""anime"" voice acting-Amazing soundtrack Cons: - *Passable-but-could-be-better* port to the Nintendo Switch's hardware — which isn't a huge issue considering how little frame dips happen.- During later parts of the game, the characters do lengthy recaps of the mystery's more complicated plot points to help clarify things. These recaps are extremely useful for players that don't have the time to play the game in long bursts — but for those looking to breeze through it in two or three days it risks taking you out of the moment. Give this gem a shot.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the humour, which I thought could be corny at times in previous titles. The game is beautiful, and I'm a fan of the art style and game engine. The only thing that sort of bothered me was that a few instances it felt like a low budget game, while at others it felt like a triple A game.

It did a great job keeping me engaged, the characters are all written in such a way that the can be related to, even though there are some crazy over the top moments which serve as comic relief when there are crimes and mysteries to solve. If you play through all the paths to get the full story, you're really in for an experience. The game is pretty long, I'd honestly compare it to an interactive book, but the game is fully voiced over so its almost like watching a crime show on tv. Fingers crossed for a sequel or another game that expands on this kind of concept because its honestly a work of art.

To get the actual end you've got to go down I believe 6-7 routes. You never have to go back to the start to do each one either which is handy.

889,1,"I played the demo of this and there was absolutely nothing in the demo that made me want to play on. The interaction was a bit annoying. I just wanted to know where the story was going, everything felt disjointed and uninteresting. Didn't like the characters and the bit I played all just felt very forced. After playing video story based games like Beyond Two Souls and Late Shift etc. Things like this just feel like bargain bin games. I can play ancient games with 8 bit sound and graphics, I don't care as long as there is substance but this had none. I played a little bit of a demo of a low graphics game, it might have been called Coffee Shop and I found that to be way more engaging. Even though it was ancient graphics and had a weird thing of making customer's drinks, it actually pulled me in to its world a bit. A.I Somnium was just strange and did nothing to draw me in to its world like Coffee Shop did and man it is so expensive it just can't be justified. If it was cheaper (like 50 quid cheaper) I might up the score to a 2, or 3 but £54, someone is having a laugh.

Im so thankful that my good pal borrowed this to me! Mostly cuz the game was really fun! But also, so I didnt have to pay for it. (You know how switch games are! I mean can you believe Nintendo? Its like a bigillion years old, and its probably like $60 still! ((Which, after playing, I think is a reasonable price!)) Disclaimer: I havent actually looked up its current price. Im just assuming, so dont flame me on Tw!tter!)Anyway! I was Hop Hop Hoppy Happy to play through this game! A genuine culinary delight! *slurp noise* (Almost as good as that catfish I had in Nawleans)Anyway! The story is super good! I wasnt sure what to expect, but man, like a piping hot $5.99 two topping dominos medium pizza, it most certainly delivers! The characters are great! This game would actually be a Bakuganfan69420 first with a 10/10 if not for that bleh ending. Speaking of the ending, [SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!] that dance sequence might have made me laugh so hard that I..... uhhhh nevermind.Anyway! Best girl was Breets! *Kreygasm* (Thats the nickname my chat came up with for that SMOKIN' secretary! Aw yeah!)

Super fun! Lots of bright colors! The story is engaging and I recommend this to everyone who owns a Nintendo Switch! Ill bet it even looks nicer on the OLED model! (I couldnt tell ya, cuz Im not fortunate enough to own one of those but hey Christmas is riiiiight around the corner! teehee!)Anyway! Thats about all I have for this game! Definitely give it a go! Even if it is still $60! Again I havent looked it up to confirm the price, but its defs worth it at that price! Ill be getting the squeequal when it comes out next year! 9/10, I probably wont play it again but I wish I could lose my memories of the game in a somnium scan (activate!) so I could relive this game in all its glory!",Bakuganfan69420,"Dec 15, 2021",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

897,7,"I agree with most of the actual reviewers on here. I'm a huge fan of the Zero Escape games. Those were an interesting (if a bit muddled) story broken up by a series of (mostly) interesting mini-puzzle games. AI, however, is much more akin to a visual novel. There aren't really ""puzzles"" in this game and even the few that are there don't make much logical sense, so it's hard to really call them puzzles in the truest sense. You have control over the order you ask questions or the places you visit, but that has absolutely no effect on anything. There are branching paths, but the split points are so obvious as to be silly. Story-wise, AI is comparable to ZE, but not nearly as good. It's pretty obvious the writer knew that the two series would be compared, so he tried to differentiate them a bit but also come up with some twists that were mostly telegraphed a little too much. And some of the humor is WAY over the top, which sometimes utterly destroys what should be really serious, emotional or tense moments. Overall, if you're a fan of the ZE games, then sure, pick this up, but at a discount. If you haven't played the ZE games yet, just go play those. If you're not a fan of ZE, there's nothing here for you.",Rtheom,"Aug 16, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

899,10,"To start I'd like to explain that just because I gave the game a 10 doesn't mean that the game is flawless. It's just that from my perspective I find it to be a masterpiece. AI: The Somnium Files is one of my favourite games/game experiences of all time. To start I'll praise what the game did undeniably well. As expected of Kotaro Uchikoshi, the writing of this game is superb. Both the unraveling of all the story elements as well as every single mystery in the game was mind-blowing. If you like the mystery genre even a little, this game has a fantastic one to offer you. Now I'd like to talk about the other elements of the game that had a mixed reaction with the general public. Personally I've found the characters to be very strong. Each of them had a quite complex personality that shown through in their interactions with one another throughout he game. However, I've noticed many people have had a problem with the characters. I do see their perspective as some of the characters could be found annoying, or foolish at times throughout the story. But in my opinion this made them seem someone more believable than characters I've found in other stories, as it seemed that the characters' perspectives on situations were wholly unique. There are also many emotional moments that resonated with me and that's why I didn't dock anything when it came to characters. Next, I'd like to explain the humour in this game. This seemed to be another divisive point when it came to this game as there are a TON of perverted jokes when it came to this game. Now I wouldn't say that I am personally a huge fan of perverted jokes but I'm not a prude when it comes to them. When it comes to the humour in this game I feel like it was really well done. Let's take a look at another game in the mystery visual novel genre, Danganronpa. I am a big fan of the Danganronpa series but one thing that bugged me was the humour. Often times the serious moments would be thrown off course in the middle of them with random bits of humour. I found that this was very intrusive, and a fault of the game as it wouldn't let some emotional moments resonate. However in AI: The Somnium Files, despite a dark gritty theme, the humour is properly timed and kept out of areas of the game that it would be inappropriate. Actually, I found that the humour was actually beneficial in AI: The Somnium Files due to the timing as it alleviated the tension when needed. Even if the humour is not to your liking, it played a great narrative purpose and so I believe it to be another good point. The gameplay wasn't anything incredible, but the interactivity of the puzzles added a certain layer of immersion. Whether it be the funny bits between Date and Aiba during the Somniums, or the emotional impact of other moments (which would be spoiler-ish if I mentioned them), I found the gameplay, while not particularly impressive, to be nice. TLDRSo despite the minor kinks in an otherwise amazing game, since the theming, mystery, characters and humour were all to my liking. I found AI: The Somnium Files to be a masterpiece and it has definitely secured a spot as one of my favourite games of all time.",PigMacLord,"Sep 27, 2021",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
900,4,"New to the anime-style ‘visual novel’ genre? This game really might not be for you. Watch some Let’s Plays or wait for a sale to try it out. The universal acclaim does not tell the whole story.The premise for AI is intriguing: You play as a futuristic cop with an artificial intelligence in his eye socket who is called in to investigate a murder. But this is a ‘visual novel’ game, meaning the story isn’t told from A to B — you have to run through it several times to view all the endings.This would be fine if the story were entertaining and the puzzles strong, like in ‘999’. But here, there are no puzzles — just a few QTEs and a handful of trial and error dream sequences.Which leaves the story. And in my view it’s an utter mess. Instead of sticking with the murder, the game jumps off into all sorts of confusing non sequiturs and plot distractions: parallel universes, double and triple crosses, secrets and hidden pasts and a stream of boring characters.At no point do you actually solve a crime: Instead of finding clues you run from location to location and exhaust dialogue options. The dialogue is crushingly dull and the anime tropes so tiresome: High school girls are there to stir adult male loins, erotic mags are thrown to distract gangsters, etc.Instead of wanting to find every ending to uncover the full truth behind all these bizarre deaths, resurrections and conspiracies, my first run through left me bored and frustrated.

901,7,"Fans of the zero escape series will get sprinkles of the series theyve come to love. Newcomers looking for an interesting take on interactive fiction will find this a great start. A large cast of characters with very detailed backgrounds. Soundtrack is very atmospheric, and voice acting is entertaining. Skipping text and scenes helps the impatient reader progress faster . Now psyncing is the other half of the game and it's a mixed bag . Part of this process is seemingly random, played by ""dream logic"". Its really hit or miss but keeps the experience fresh as every dream psync is a glance into another character's mind, like a soft take on psychonauts. Overall I enjoyed the experience and found myself scanning every background item for every nugget of flavored dialogue and humor. Theres even hidden endings if you persist with background options or the games certain points where you can refuse or accept ridiculous conditions. That all said, the 75% mark as you go fillin in the blanks can be confusing keeping track of what has or hasnt happened.about an hour of slugging through that could've been done a bit better by explaining briefly what happened in this path/point in the story. Overall a great game and a must play for fans of zero escape.

902,5,"The game story and characters are good, I really learned to like most of them, especially Moma.What's not so good in my opinion is the puzzles, pacing and dumb jokes. The game is really good when it's serious, but some parts are so cringy I wanted to just delete the game.The puzzles in the somniums are not very intuitive and they are annoying, since they're all within a dream. Also, the somnium puzzles are timed, but even if you fail you can just retry as many times as you want, so what is even the point?Most of the investigation is just go to all places, click on everything, talk to everyone, and you progress. That's not a detective game, that's a VN. This is not even close to Nonary games or similar.",ulundor,"Nov 16, 2022",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
903,9,"Good story based game with mystery, horror, and mind bendy moments. I'll say compared to his previous works, tho overall it was perhaps a tad less intense than I expected (slightly, maybe cause other moments are more lighthearted), albeit the final reveal was not as shocking as previous games.  I think it was a pretty good blend. Tho thinking back there are some very intense/gory scenes so it definitely gets it's M rating, and is not something I'd want someone to accidentally walk in on per the more intense moments,  The ending was strong, albeit I managed to figure out parts of it.  I like the somnium gameplay elements a lot more than I expected, you do have to reset a lot at times so some moments prob penalize you too strongly, but the witty dialogue and process of trial and error was a lot of fun.  Some of it seems to make sense too from a loosely connected sense in how events may be interpretted in the dream/somnium world instead per the viewers pov. Some solid character writing, I particularly love Aiba, though Date, Iris, and Mitsuki are all voiced and portrayed quite well too. The English VA is a thing of beauty, fits the characters very well, n the devs did a solid job of making the character animations expressive and interesting, n keeping a tense atmosphere Per the parts that could use improvement, I do like the story branching, albeit a solid chunk of it (maybe 2-4 hours) felt like a rehash because of similar events.  So some parts of the story felt like I had to sludge through it / the pacing was way too slow or repetitive, but the overall story and payoff and reveals is pretty solid and is tied up pretty well.  It makes some sense as some of that is laying the groundwork, but I was playing with a friend at the time and the rehash didn't seem to add much at first glance, mayhaps cause it was played too closely together.  Clicking on non-important items in the environment was mostly worthless and a waste of time to click on, instead of having witty dialogue, it mostly just blandly described the item.  I.e., clicking on a tv or banner on the wall would say something dull like ""This is a tv"" or ""A banner hanging on the wall"".  Felt lazy and tbh a waste of time, items shouldn't be clickable if it has no purpose and adds nothing to the lore of the world or to flesh out the character's perspective.  Would've been better to not have it and give the illusion of things to do when there was none, i.e. playing with my friend, seemed a waste of time when he played and tried to click through everything bc the flavor text was so bland.  The jokes on Dates reaction time was way over used and got tired, and the quick time events segment were also pretty meh.  Not that I care that much about it, but I feel the pacing and everything would've been better to either just leave it out, or to make it simpler.  It's already dead simple, so having to hold a button or track an item for 5-10 secs is about as fun as...wait, it's not fun or challenging.  That said, either it should've been fleshed out or just ignored/simplified to just a button press or a quick point and click.  As is it didn't add much, but that's fine, the meat and potatoes is of course the story and somnium gameplay, the other stuff should instead, imo, just be streamlined to progress the story.  As mentioned before, some somnium element penalties could have been lessened to reduce the number of restarts, and to encourage more exploration/trial of non-essential elements.  There isn't a ton of replay value once you've beaten the game I think, I mean it'd be interesting to go through some parts of the story to see nuances, but it's a long story based game.  Idk if it's be worth it for the little nods.  The somnium portions might be fun to run through again, primarily though if a no penalty/invincible mode existed.  It'd be more interesting to replay if you brought someone new in to explore it, probably. (spoiler alert!!)One character I had to suspend some disbelief, it may've been nice if their ability had some kind of explanation, but didn't really happen. (M's power.) I guess the motive for another character in some paths is not really explained much either. (P's motivations)(end spoiler alert) Overall, the story is cleverly done with likable characters, who are well voiced and fleshed out well.  The ending wraps things up pretty nicely, and the overall story is interesting with good attention to detail.  The way things unravel helps keep the mystery elements pretty strong throughout.  Not much in terms of replayability, but overall another interesting, mind bendy, unique work of art by the dev. I'd give it like a 88.  A bit more streamlining to keep th story flowing, n less rehash wld help. If they could find a way to add mor replay value it'd make it mor worth th full $60, as I got about the avg complete time frm it 27 hrs or so, tho the production qualities r certainly improving. I'm open to seeing more work from th dev in the future",DeltaPeng,"Apr 19, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
904,10,"This has become my favorite Visual Novel of all time. Having played Uchikoshi's other VNs I expected to like it, but I figured that there would be at least one character I didn't enjoy. Every character felt well developed, so that even the ones I didn't like I could enjoy disliking. Also, this game was so much funnier than I expected! I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. The story is well developed and critical information is delivered at a good pace to give you the chance to make guesses and keep revising as you learn more. The important twists are well constructed, so that you have all the information you need to have guessed them and whether you did figure them out ahead of time or not the reveal is satisfying. All in all, it was a fantastic mystery experience front to back and I fully recommend it.",Khaz,"Apr 29, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
905,10,"Probably the best interactive story game I've ever played.It was a chunky one too, took me several weekends to finally get through it.The gameplay can be a bit tedious though, wasn't a huge fan of the system set up to dive into someone's mind. Everytime that would occur I kinda dreaded it because sometimes these can get lengthy for a sliver of plot that you get in return. Also I'd be constantly worried that I'd get myself killed and have to repeat something. Once I started understanding how the branching paths worked though this got a lot easier to speed through. The game did a good job letting you know what decision caused it to branch out.The story and character in this, I absolutely loved. The story is absolutely bonkers. It's all sorta confusing at first and I can totally seeing it being nonsensical at first but towards the end things make sense. This also took some story paths that I did not see coming and was pleasantly surprised with. It waz very drama heavy but broke up that drama with some humor.Humor is super subjective but I found the humor used here was amazing. I definitely laughed out loud a few times with some of the jokes and cuteness. It got kinda silly in such a fun, high camp sort of way. If you appreciate camp then this will definitely work for ya.Overall I had such an amazing time with this, I felt so fulfilled by the end with my experience. You know it's good when months later I still recall how fun of an adventure this was.",Tortor,"Oct 25, 2021",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

908,9,"No soy especial fan de las Visual Novels, aunque he disfrutado algunas, por ello este juego ha pasado por debajo de mi radar hasta recientemente, poco antes de lanzarse la secuela que descubrí que el desarrollador era el mismo equipo detrás de la saga 999 y me lance a por ella. He de decir que a nivel de historia, seguramente sea una de las mejores VN, poniéndote en la piel de un detective con un trasfondo de ciencia ficción que te tiene dando vueltas y comiéndote la cabeza durante todo el juego, mientras hace buen uso del ""efecto mariposa"" en las distintas bifurcaciones que podemos tomar. El juego te mantiene activo mentalmente intentando encajar las piezas del puzzle y resolver el caso hasta el increíblemente apoteósico final verdadero, donde ya sabes como va a acabar todo y aún así es imposible no emocionarte. Eso sí, hay algún personaje que se me hizo bastante insoportable durante el juego, sobre todo en algunos caminos...Ota... Sin embargo, como digo no soy especialmente fan de las VN, y aquellas que más he disfrutado son las que son capaces de integrar de forma orgánica el gameplay de la VN con otro genero, generalmente el de puzzle. Esto es algo que la saga 999 hace a la perfección (así como otras como la saga ace attorney o el profesor layton). Sin embargo, aquí la dinámica de puzzle esta integrada cuando entramos en los sueños de otros personajes. Esta mecánica orgánica es, pero justamente al trabajar en sueños, las soluciones de los puzzles resultan realmente aleatorias, y la mayor parte del tiempo los resolveremos por prueba y error (aunque hay excepciones, y hay algunos sueños realmente interesantes). Aparte de esto, el juego incorpora momentos de ""quick-events"" que le aportan variedad y resultan cuanto menos cómicos. Otro problema de mecánica (y este si que es de la parte de VN) es que la habilidad de pasar rápido el texto no esta del todo bien implementada... solo permitiendonos pasar una línea de texto si la hemos escuchada en la bifurcación que actualmente estamos, pero no si ya la escuchamos en otra, haciendo la exploración de varias rutas un tanto tediosa a veces (aunque la capacidad de saltar al momento que queramos de las rutas desbloqueadas se agradece a cambio). También existe un bug que aparece a veces que te permite saltar texto que NO HAS VISTO previamente. No es molesto, pero si no te das cuenta puede hacerte pasar líneas de dialogo importante y hacerte abrir el backlog para leerlas. También cabe mencionar, de que aunque no influya apenas por el tipo de juego que es, la versión de switch al menos tiene problemas de rendimiento. Ocurren a veces, que tarda unos segundos en mostrarnos la siguiente línea. Solo ocurre en algunos momentos en algunas rutas (especialmente hacía el final), y sí que puede llegar a resultar algo molesto a veces. Así pues, el juego tiene fallos, y personalmente esta por debajo de 999, pero no en su historia que es en última instancia, la parte más importante aquí.",Sunshadow87,"Aug  7, 2022",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

916,9,"Un cadáver es descubierto en un parque de diversiones abandonado, la víctima presenta numerosas perforaciones en su abdomen y le falta el ojo izquierdo. Las circunstancias del asesinato se asimilan mucho a unos asesinatos en serie que tomaron lugar 6 años antes de los acontecimientos del juego, donde también las víctimas aparecían sin un ojo.Así empieza la historia de nuestro protagonista Kaname Date, un detective que misteriosamente también le falta su ojo izquierdo, en el cual tiene un ojo prostético donde reside su compañera de investigación, una inteligencia artificial de última generación conocida como Aiba. Date es parte del departamento policíaco metropolitano de Tokyo perteneciente a la división conocida como ABIS que se encarga de infiltrarse en la mente de los sospechosos para conseguir información que estos no recuerdan o simplemente no quieren presentar.AI: the Somnium Files es el último juego del director Kotaro Uchikoshi, creador de la aclamada trilogía de supervivencia y misterio “Zero Escape”. Tu trabajo es descubrir quién es el culpable, investigando las diversas escenas del crimen e interrogando a los sospechosos aún si estos no recuerdan información valiosa para la investigación, pues gracias a tu compañera Aiba, puedes acceder a los sueños de dichos sospechosos para tratar de interpretarlos y sacar información valiosa.El juego se divide en dos partes, la primera consiste en investigaciones, ya sea de las escenas del crimen, interrogando a los personajes de la historia o simplemente dialogando con ellos para conocerlos más a fondo, tratando de sacar cualquier información relevante para la investigación. Lo bien escritos que están todos los personajes y las personalidades de ambos protagonistas (Date y Aiba) hacen que todos los diálogos tengan un humor increíble. Sin lugar a duda, parte de la magia de los diálogos está en los monólogos que suceden entra Aiba y Date.La segunda parte del juego consiste en entrar en los sueños de los sospechosos, donde puedes moverte libremente dentro de los mismos, interactuando con objetos, tratando de remover los bloqueos mentales que protegen la información que tanto estas buscando. Dentro de los sueños hay un límite de tiempo de 6 minutos bien justificado por la historia, pero no te preocupes, en caso de no poder solucionar el sueño siempre puedes empezar de nuevo sin ningún tipo de penalidad.Al igual que los otros juegos de Uchikoshi, tus decisiones cuentan y van moldeando la historia a tu alrededor, en varios momentos tus acciones abren diversos caminos, estos pueden verse en el “flowchart” del juego, una especie de línea temporal gráfica donde puedes ver por qué camino estás yendo y te permite saber fácilmente si otra decisión hubiera abierto otro futuro por donde pudiste haberte ido. Estos futuros son completamente diferentes el uno del otro, siempre dándote información relevante para tu investigación. En cualquier momento de la historia puedes ir hacia atrás en el flowchart y elegir otro camino, pero ten en cuenta que Date no recuerda lo que hizo en otra ruta tomada previamenteAI: the Somnium Files es uno de los mejores juegos que he tenido la oportunidad de jugar en los últimos años, la historia me hizo lagrimear más de una vez y los personajes están tan bien escritos que encariñarse con ellos es solo cuestión de tiempo. La historia es extremadamente memorable, sigo pensando en el juego días después de terminarlo. Uchikoshi diseña su historia de una manera que siempre hay giros en la trama y todo lo que creías se va por la borda. Súmale a esto que los personajes fueron diseñados por el diseñador de Fire Emblem y la música te mantendrá enganchado de principio a fin.Ningún juego es perfecto, el límite de tiempo dentro de los sueños puede verse como una limitación molesta, pues siempre se puede empezar sin penalidad, esto sumado a que si eres una persona que no le gusta leer mucho, este no es el juego para ti.Me tomó aproximadamente 24 horas conseguir el true ending.

923,9,"GREAT GAME, I picked this while on 50% sale. I would really like to have amnesia just to play this game again! The story is Dark with some surprising twist. Sometimes complicated but very interesting and the game try their best to tell you so you won't get confused. There's a lot of joke too, and it's hilarious and random. If you try to interact with everything in this game, you may be rewarded with jokes and sometimes it's pop culture jokes u may reckon from another things. The Gameplay is a thing u can't find anywhere else. Mainly, You'll play in a ""Somnium"" where you must interact with something to trigger a Memories of someone in cost of Time, Time out you lose. The character is memorable. I love Mizuki! I love the Music and A-Set Song. The VA is also very good, but I always prefer Japanese to make authentic experience.There's a minor problems tho. Sometimes the graphics looks blurry (Switch), I think this is the area where game dev can actually make more efforts. In a cutscene where you'll move to another location, hiccups framerate will happened (Switch), but this won't affect your gameplay. I mentioned earlier that this Story is complicated, Some people may not enjoy and can't follows the plot. Some may be will complained with lack of gameplay.But overall this is GREAT, if you're looking for Story based game / Visual Novel kinda like game with Unique gameplay!

927,7,"Here's a plain old, honest review. AI:TSF is a good game by all means. It's not trash, and it's not brilliant. The game starts out really interesting but tends to fall flat by not being able to decide whether it's a dark, adult-oriented mystery, or a comedy for high schoolers due to the near constant sexual jokes. The story isn't very emotionally gripping and the characters, for the most part, are annoying as hell,  the only one I enjoyed seeing was Mama. Some of the Somniums absolutely suck, with one of them having basically only a SINGLE way to beat it. Getting the true ending is HELL unless you're patient (and it's a letdown anyway), because you need to complete EVERY ROUTE before you can get it which took me roughly 50 hours, and maybe 3 routes at the most were worth it. It IS made by the same guy who made the Zero Escape series, and perhaps if you're not sure if that's for you, give this a shot. 999 alone is already much better, but that's only my opinion. It's still worth a playthrough, just not at full price.",junepei,"Oct 22, 2020",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch

929,7,"FBI Special Agent Sean Archer survives an assassination attempt by freelance terrorist and homicidal sociopath Castor Troy, but the bullet penetrates Archer's chest and strikes his son Michael, killing the boy. Six years later, Archer's vendetta against Troy culminates in his team's ambush of Troy and his younger brother and accomplice Pollux at a remote desert airstrip. Troy goads Archer with knowledge of a bomb located somewhere in Los Angeles set to go off in a few days, but he is knocked into a coma before Archer can learn more. Pollux, in custody, affirms that the bomb is real, but refuses to reveal its location. At the suggestion of his partner Tito Biondi and Special Ops specialist Hollis Miller, Archer reluctantly secretly undergoes a highly experimental face transplant procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh to take on Troy's face, voice, and appearance. Archer is taken to the same high-security prison where Pollux is being held, and slowly convinces Pollux that he is Troy, gaining information on the bomb's location. Meanwhile, Troy unexpectedly awakens from his coma and discovers his face missing. He calls his gang, and they force Dr. Walsh to transplant Archer's face onto him. Troy then kills Dr. Walsh, Biondi, and Miller, the only three who knew of the transplant. At the prison, Archer prepares to tell Biondi of the location but is surprised when Troy appears instead, with Archer's face. Troy goads Archer that no one knows of the transplant, and that he will take over Archer's life. Pollux is freed when he willingly tells Troy-as-Archer of the bomb's location, and Troy disarms the bomb in a dramatic fashion. Troy-as-Archer earns admiration from the FBI office and becomes close to Archer's wife Eve and daughter Jamie, whom Archer had been neglecting while chasing down Troy. Meanwhile, Archer-as-Troy escapes after staging a riot and retreats to Troy's headquarters posing as Troy. There, he meets Sasha, the sister of Troy's primary drug kingpin, and her son Adam, who reminds Archer of Michael. Archer discovers that Adam is Troy's son. Troy learns of Archer's escape and hastily assembles a team to raid his headquarters. The raid quickly turns into a bloodbath, killing numerous FBI agents and several members of Troy's gang, including Pollux. During this, Archer, Sasha, and Adam are able to escape. Archer's supervisor, Director Victor Lazarro, blames Troy-as-Archer for the numerous slayings. Troy, furious over Pollux's death, kills Lazarro, making it look like a heart attack. Troy-as-Archer is promoted to acting director as plans are made for Lazarro's funeral. Archer finds safety for Sasha and Adam. He then approaches Eve, and convinces her to test Troy-as-Archer's blood to prove his identity. Convinced of her husband's identity, Eve tells Archer that Troy will be vulnerable at Lazarro's funeral. At the ceremony, Archer finds that Troy has anticipated his actions and takes Eve hostage. Sasha arrives, and a gunfight ensues; Sasha manages to save Eve after taking a bullet. Archer promises a dying Sasha to take care of Adam and raise him away from criminal life. Troy flees the church with Archer pursuing him. Before killing two more federal agents, Troy briefly takes Jamie hostage, but she escapes by stabbing him with a butterfly knife that Troy had given her for self-defense. A speedboat chase ensues in which Archer forces Troy to shore by collision, then bests Troy in a melee fight. Troy mutilates his own/Archer's face to taunt and distract him, but Archer instead gains the upper hand and impales Troy with a spear gun, killing him. Backup agents arrive and address Archer by name, having been convinced by Eve of Archer's true identity. After the face transplant surgery is reversed, Archer returns home, adopting Adam into his family and keeping his promise to Sasha.",LTWasabi,"Jun 28, 2021",AI: The Somnium Files,Switch
930,9,"AI: The somnium files is an awesome games. Great direction and great story. Lots of twist and turn. This game is futuristic of our time and could be said to be Ai: The Somnium Files 2077 Story: It is amazing story that you should play by yourself. The branching path story with several endings. A little predictable but when it all come together. You will felt surprised and even impressed by the creativity and innovativeness of the story. Gameplay: It is visual novel style when progressing the story but turned into escape room during somnium or dream world investigation phase. Visual novel phase is similar to Professor Layton where you can touch to learn more about it which also lead to funny and unexpected dialogue. There are quick button press event that is wacky and very fun to watch. Anything is possible which make it funny and make you felt wow. It is true meaning of Cyberpunk if you ask me. For somnium world is the reason to play this game. Aiba and Date interaction in this phase is full of emotion with every choice you make. Every choice are full of references. Somnium dive are awesome as every somnium is different. I always want to play this mode more and more. It is very creative and innovative for this mode. Music: Overall composition and song during gameplay are great and match to all story. Yes, the one song with lyrics is quite a cringe. They try to make VTuber style character but lyrics and the song is no match for each other. The lyric is important as it tells story but please make the song listenable next time for English audience. I played this game in Autumn 2019, if I knew VTuber such as Hololive or Nijisanji exist at that time. I would just open their song on tops of it happens. They have one in the ending as well which is double-edge sword, you want to listen to it because it is the ending song and lots of interaction between characters in the game but the song is just screeching to the ear and make my music sense worse for 3 months after listening to it. Conclusion: This is true cyberistic experience, Many impossible things became possible, Unique and intense story and gameplay which will blow your mind. Funny and humorous game but can be get tense and full of emotion. It is MSG of gameplay that will spice things up and make it looks awesome.

La jugabilidad es más amplia que lo habitual dentro del género, ya que podremos investigar los escenarios y resolver los puzzles del Somnium. La historia sigue siendo guiada, y no puedes saltarte nada importante, más allá de las habituales rutas para diferentes finales de este género. Los personajes son muy carismáticos y bien desarrollados, siendo lo mejor del juego. Los gráficos son muy buenos dentro de este género, con unos controles y músicas muy correctos. Lo mejor, la historia y los personajes, con un gran final, y siendo necesario hacer todas las rutas para comprender la historia en su totalidad. Lo peor, las fases del somnium, al ser necesario ensayo y error en nunerosas ocasiones, se pueden hacer pesadas, y durante toda la historia las bromas sexuales son continuas, aunque en su mayoría pueden resultar graciosas, a veces se siente excesivo.

This is a very psychological driven story with complex characters who are unique, honestly enough said. I rarely say a game is perfect, but damn this is oh so close to that.

941,9,"AI: The Somnium Files is a visual novel style adventure game that is fairly unique and with some strong story telling. Kotaro Uchikoshi games all have this sense of over-the-top sci fi wackiness with stories that feel tailor made for being a video game. It doesn't really feel like his stories can exist on other platforms and come off as well made as they are. That doesn't mean everything is a hit. There's a few points in this game that come off as flimsy, almost like they came up with a really neat idea but couldn't figure a good way to tie it in with the proceeding plot points. And not every character works in the grand scheme of things. Some are just very annoying to have on screen and don't serve a large purpose to the overall story. The puzzles can be fun and unique too but the way they are designed can be rough. If you've realized you won't make it to the end before the time runs out, the back up checkpoint system they added here won't really save you. It can be tedious to finally figure out the puzzle at the end and not have the time needed to complete it so you have to restart it all over. But, at the end of the day, it's all worth it here. I would make a recommendation that, if you plan on playing this primarily on the Switch in docked mode to only play in handheld mode. The docked mode for this game is one of the worst I've seen on Switch. There's alot of tearing on the character models throughout the whole thing. The FPS can drop to single digits at times. And any animated cutscene had multiple studders and freezes throughout the whole game with some full on crashes at times.

944,6,"Twitter is not the world, I'm writing this and I'm wasting my time on this because I cared about the series, note the past tense used in the sentence.I've tried not to do spoilers so I won't touch on all the problematic points.Theres a ton of little problems that put together recreate a mediocre experience.Ryuki and Tama feel solid  but I was pretty disappointed because you only get them for the first part of the game.The somniums are better than the first game accompanied by the new VR sections that are quite good and it is better optimized than the first one in the technical compartement (almost no frame drops) with the audio voices top notch both in english and in japanise, however in a game that makes story its centerpiece it is not enough to excuse the flaws of the writing.Story which honestly seemed more interesting in the beginning than the one in the first game, but soon gets trite and rehashed.Mizuki and Aiba's dynamic is alot worst than Date and Aiba. The former fell pretty flat for me compared to the latter.My main problem is that Mizuki didn't really have much of a character arc.Gimmicks aside you could swap her with anyone and the game would still work,  nothing changes story wise.It's amazing how much of a step back she is to her first game appearance.Her chemistry with Aiba is kinda ok, but there's not really any deep bonding going on like Ryuki and Tama, who shoulda have gone back to being the leads in the last act since they had more to overcome.The pacing was worse than the first game.It would really help to make the game shorter and the plot tighter without all the bloat like the constant pointless detours or especialy the parts where the characters just keep repeating the same plot points over and over.Localization cut some stuff whitout motive, i can guarantee that the in game voice of a certain tool misses pieces of info (which I won't mention for spoilers).I liked the first AI game and this one felt lackluster compared to that.Still, it is worth checking out if you enjoyed the 1st game, at 20 euro no more than that.it's not the disappointment that ZTD was but it's closer than I expected.",Cobalt_Red,"Jul 13, 2022",AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative,Switch

949,8,"Once more, a reminder to fans of the zero escape series, with about as many sprinkles as they've come to expect from the latest release from Chunsoft. Newcomers looking for an interesting take on interactive fiction will find the previous title holds up strongly and helps carry characters over to this title. Many will say you don't need to play the first, but I disagree. The two titles are as strong as one another, so if you do enjoy this one as a first, try the prequel. A larger! cast of characters than game one, detailed backgrounds, but a lot of reused tracks.  Voice acting is still as entertaining. Skipping text and scenes helps the impatient reader/player/fra*** progress faster *wink* A lot of the plot has many points where you may find yourself frustrated with character actions illogically done for the sake of pacing around some very very bizarre narrative mechanics. Don't pull out any notes for plot purposes, a lot of it is convoluted and constantly shifting with little rhyme or reason. Now the puzzles both in and out of somniums (the game's dream world zones, taking up half the gameplay) are excellent and some required note taking for escape room enthusiasts. Particular end game content made for a great callbacks and improve on the 999 puzzle room formulas. The dreams are far more parodying pop culture in a mix between psychonaut mind dives and game mechanic experimentation. They're far more forgiving and can have multiple solutions to progress. RPG fans will once more find themselves scanning every background item for every nugget of flavored dialogue and humor.

951,5,"was so desperately trying to force myself to like this game. The charm however is just not there with the characters this time around The plot also dragged on and wasn't terribly interesting. The only thing keeping my going was a lot of really fun factoids with philosophy and science were explored and implemented in the plot in ways I didn't expect. What the plot did with what could have been a cool premise though just failed to be exciting and felt like it was overly fluffed out with so much uninteresting garbage that i was constantly combating with myself on not wanting to go any farther but being committed because I was such a fan. The characters, although familiar because most are returning from the prior game. They just all arnt as likable anymore. It's clear that the writers expected you to play the first game because you're sorta given the developed characters from the first game and they just stay that way. The returning characters sorta lost their charm because not a lot of exploration into who they are happened as deeply as before. The newer characters explored just wernt very interesting either and I found them all so unlikable. For a plot focused game this was disappointing. I was such a fan of the first game that I seriously recommend it to everyone. I think however the game just have been a stand alone and there really was no need at all for this sequal. This just felt like it was trying to do plot twists as good as before and constantly trying to one up itself but honestly nothing came across as shocking. Some of the mysteries constantly were so vague that I just found it so boring when some of the less interesting stuff was explored. What infuriated me the most about this game was the over-use of the 'their phone is off' plot device. Like.... Everyone had a phone that's off somehow and this is used as a plot device constantly to get your character to visit every single area to scope out that character that isnt anywhere and only gets revealed once you visit everywhere. This is so incredibly annoying when it's done over and over and over and over and over again. It felt so forced and uncreative. I would have loved a more natural feeling of movement from place to place. The reused assets were also annoying. So much was reused from the previous game that I was exhausted seeing some of these places again that I've already seen so much of from the first game. Combine that with the previous complaint of visiting areas over and over, ugh, this was bad. This sequal really didn't need to happen.",Tortor,"Oct 22, 2022",AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative,Switch

Airborne Kingdom, as its name implies, changes up the normal formula by moving everything upward, which introduces mobility to the table where resource gathering in particular is concerned, and then unique problems like being sure that you don’t develop things in a way that could make your city float in a lopsided fashion, spelling disaster or at the very least a perturbed citizenry. What complicates things is that the UI and controls aren’t ideal, feeling far more geared towards play on a PC and even when you settle in with them continuing to feel cumbersome for common functions. If you’re patient and in need of something new in the space at least the pretty extensive lore and storytelling help to keep you incentivized to continue to progress, even if perhaps the overall play tends to be a bit limited in scope compared to typical empire-building sims. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/11/mini-reviews-november-11th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 16, 2021",Airborne Kingdom,Switch

985,6,"I like this game but it’s important to know what it is before buying it. This is a remaster of the first Akiba’s Trip game released for the psp (only in Japan until now). Here’s what this means: This is a remaster meaning little to no QOL improvements. The graphics have been upgraded a little but don’t expect anything stellar. Expect a psp game with better graphics This was originally a psp game and the psp only has one thumb stick. This means camera controls are poor. They let you use the 2nd thumb stick on the switch to control your camera sometimes but in combat the camera doesn’t always show what you want it to. It’s playable but not great. This is the 1st Akiba’s Trip game meaning they refined the experience in Undead and Undressed. They took out the things that didn’t work in this game and made that one much better because of it. Experiences that I found to be worse in this game are: 1. Combat - its less fluid (and that’s saying something), you can get beat up on by a large group of opponents without a chance to defend yourself until someone lands a large hit on you and ejects you, the camera is worse making it hard to track opponents, building up a chain combo is more difficult, and probably a couple smaller things I can’t remember. There were several times this straight up lagged especially during strip combos so the frame rate is bad. 2. Side quests - a few were enjoyable but probably half of them were just go here and fight X for Y reason. There are also some real PITA ones that are in no way enjoyable and others that are difficult if not impossible to complete on the 1st play through. 3. Navigation between areas - not only do you have fewer areas than in the sequel but they are smaller and every time you leave one you exit to the main map. Load times are as bad as the vita version of the sequel if not worse. There’s a few more minor things that would take a lot of explaining to describe which probably isn’t worth the space. Imagine playing assassin’s creed brotherhood (or 2 or revelations) first and then going back and playing the 1st assassin’s creed. It’s one thing if you played the original before the sequel but going back to play the original after playing the sequel really brings to attention all the flaws in the original. Now that I’ve bashed the game enough here’s what I liked: It’s another Akiba’s trip experience. It’s really unlikely they are going to make a new one so I’m happy to explore the original. It’s not as fun as the sequel but there’s still fun to be had. The story was decent. Kind of weird pacing. I didn’t find it to be particularly good or bad. If anything it was just weirder and more otaku focused than the sequel. Collectibles were just as good if not better than the first. I liked getting more of the weirder clothing options. My first play through I ended with a frog head, soccer ball body, and shrine maiden legs. I don’t think I could make a combination that weird in the sequel. You don’t get to change your walk style without changing characters though which is unfortunate as I liked that feature in the sequel. A few more notes. My game has crashed twice so far after long sessions. I save often so it was a minor annoyance to me but I got that habit after the sequel crashing on my vita whenever my wardrobe got full. If you don’t save often you may end up regretting it. I only noticed this happened after several hours of play which is both good and bad. I thought the English voice acting was fine but I think most English voice acting is fine especially in the last 10 years or so. I’ve heard others complain about it though. A few months from now people will probably have better guides on where to find items needed for quests. If you get annoyed if you can’t find something or if you need to fail a side quest because you don’t have the right skills then hold off on this game for a month or so. Right now it’s hard to find help on the internet in English for this game. All that said I’m having fun with it and I’m happy with my purchase. It’s about what I expected when I bought it and I was neither pleasantly surprised nor disappointed by the quality of the remaster. I’m just happy to play this game in English with an official translation.",Gecko0,"Jul 29, 2021",Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed,Switch

It’s interesting to walk around and get sidetracked by some shops or other distractions (though some of the mini games are also a bit gross, unless you’re into it) but it also doesn’t feel like enough time and effort were put into vital elements like the game’s lackluster combat… unless you’re really into the fact that clothes are shed along the way.

Alba may not be a very long or meaty game, but its wholesome characters, super-chill wandering and discovering, and even inclusion of the element of getting great snaps of the local wildlife at least makes it a joy. Feeling incredibly well-suited to the Switch, a joy whether in handheld mode or docked, I appreciate its slightly more distinctive sense of style and tone even among its other laid back contemporaries. If you’re looking for something to take a few hours to enjoy, simply taking in nature and a bit of wonder along the way, this is a great option for you on the eShop. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/08/mini-reviews-august-16th-edition.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",Alba: a Wildlife Adventure,Switch

997,9,"I love this game! It's wholesome af, the music and graphics are incredible, and it's chill af. Only thing I found annoying was clean up island quest (super hard to find last patch), however you don't need that to finish the game.

999,10,"A peculiar blend of RPG and strategy games. Very dark and grim. It has that 'hard-to-catch' vibe of Fallout 1 and 2. That longing, that desolation after the world crumbled. Then again, I felt the same 'melody' when playing Planescape: Torment, over 20 years years ago. I have no idea how such a gem went under my radar.

1000,9,"So I got this game after the large bugzfixing patch from a few days ago and I can say I'm  impressive so far. Got 5-ish hours into the game so far and haven't experience any bugs. The art style is really cool and the story is wonderful. The gameplay is tactical, with three hunters in a mission having to use abilities and items wisely. With the ""odor/smell"" mechanism that will make you plan ahead does make for interesting play and is a pretty neat feature. Overall, highly recommend for those looking for a darker, story-driven tactical rpg-like game.",Loncia,"Jun  9, 2020",Alder's Blood,Switch
1001,10,"I bought this when first released on Switch, and there a couple of things, like the random wind switches and quick corruption of hunters that bothered me a bit. Still though it was a great game with great potential, but didn't play it much because i got into something else. One day i seen patch 0.6 was in and i updated gamed. In going back i can see alot of issues have been ironed out. This game is extremely good. It has something that sets it apart as an RPG. For one the story is extremely well developed, and after Japanese RPG fatigue, it is very refreshing to get something like this. The game gets pretty difficult and there gets a point where you must develop careful strategy to progress. You cannot just blaze through it. The graphical style is refreshing and different. It has a certain aura and quality that gives a certain vibe. Somehow the story resonates with our own times, and i think this is what makes it interesting. Couple things i would still like to see 'improved', but considering this is an indie development this games deserves a solid 10/10.",DecoyDoctorpus,"Jun 22, 2020",Alder's Blood,Switch

1005,9,"Challenging, inventive, compelling, this is the best TBT game since XCOM 2.  Stealthy, hit-and-run tactics are key here and is well implemented. Each encounter feels  fresh and and each move requires thought and planning. Who knew griefing werewolves could be so much fun?

1006,10,"Absolutely fantastic game, with a brilliant setting of Lovecraft’s themes in an almost apocalyptic old west wasteland. Love the horror and tactical strategy mix. Wonderfully dark and well thought out story far beyond what you’d normally see in this genre, with great characters, and much deeper game play mechanics than I’d expected. Well written dialogue, beautiful art design, and an ominous and haunting soundtrack to round it out. More proof that quality does not only come from AAA games, but from talented developers with a passion project.",H1senberg,"Mar 14, 2020",Alder's Blood,Switch
1007,9,"This is my first review ever and this is probably one of the best modern, tactical-strategy around. I find it insane it came from an indie developer because sure as hell it doesn't look like an indie game. So, in a nutshell, because I am really lazy and it's really late:In alternative reality X-com decided it doesn't want to be Sci-Fi and about aliens anymore. So it went through some weird warp tunnel but met Great Cthulhu on the way and they had a baby and then suddenly Bloodborne came and was like 'hey sup' and became the baby's godfather and taught the kid all the ins and outs and that baby's grew up to be known as Alder's Blood.Its RPG, its strategy, its massive lore and a book-worthy story and plot.In the indie league - its a GOTY material.",Lady_F,"Mar 13, 2020",Alder's Blood,Switch
1008,4,"A Game with a crazy amount of potential. The corruption mechanic ended up being too harsh for me, about  5 hours in i ran out of hunters over night and out of money (used to hire new hunters), and just threw the towel in. I love hard game, but the difficulty here fails to make it fun. A little sad as i feel i wasted some good game dollars, but i believe that with a little tweaking this game could be amazing. It has a lot of good things going on for it, butt the difficultiy makes hard to enjoy them. (The wind changing direction without warning really!?)",CantinRenard,"Mar 16, 2020",Alder's Blood,Switch

But I'm surprised by the high user ratings here (also because the company advertises with the high metascore).It seems to me that some of them are not honest reviews.

You didn't hide ur score was given after playing only a short demo(mini prequel) from last year, where 90% of things this game offers doesn't appear. Ofc this is a publisher mistake to not update ""mini-prequel"" and leave potential players with wrong reception of their work. But i don't think game deserve so bad reviews, It is challenging, nice designed game with interesting mechanic which need to be a little bit polished to be great. 7/10 from me and i w8 for patches to make it 8 or maybe even better.",vdkc2h5oh,"Apr 10, 2020",Alder's Blood,Switch
1011,8,"Now this one took me by surprise. Incredibly solid game for a newcoming indie studio.

1015,8,"This is quite good, for being a budget game. The graphics are simple and functional, they look nice. Several enemy types with varied attack patterns. Very nice music, and okay sound effects. Levels have a decent design and can at times be a little challenging but not too much. At full price it might not be worth it but you should definitely get it when it's on sale. Out of hundreds of budget games I've checked out, this absolutely belongs in the upper 25%, hence the score. I like the game and it's nice to play, it's obvious that the developer has made an effort here. Only downside is that the knight looks very pale in the face. Is he undead or just a chain-smoker?",Daige,"Feb  8, 2022",Aldred - Knight of Honor,Switch
1016,0,"I bought the collection - not least because of the extremely positive feedback from the press. After trying out the thoroughly aged games for a while, I was disappointed beyond measure. Especially the first title, Aleste 1, is actually unenjoyable without the solidly implemented comfort features. The game is very simplistic and unfairly difficult. The gameplay is also nothing special, even though reviewers often try to construct a historical relevance here that I don't see in any way. Darius (1987), for example, is even older and has aged much better.The remaining titles play better, but are still inferior in quality to other early genre representatives in my opinion. The solid restoration as well as the functional enhancements are template-like, but still well done. After all, this is where the developer studio M2 has distinguished itself over the years. Nevertheless, even the updates don't save the overall package.The 2020 GG Aleste 3 is admittedly conceptually interesting as a postmodern pastiche. The game is ultimately symptomatic of an infatuation with the aesthetics and gameplay experience of the past, but to put it polemically on the level of a mobile game from the late 2000s. KAll in all, I strongly advise against buying it. For those who consider such releases as collector's items, be my guest, for any ""rational"" buyer the price is almost a cheek.P.S.:The 8-bit soundtrack was still cool (even if that's not a reason to buy).",johnny34,"Mar 29, 2022",Aleste Collection,Switch
1017,5,"Miracle World DX is Merge Games' attempt to polish a turd. Graphically it's a great remake that allows you to seamlessly switch on the fly between remastered and classic visual modes. Some of the remade audio tracks are also brilliant and go far beyond the original's score. Where the game falls apart is the gameplay. Miracle World DX is too faithful to the original's gameplay and is ball-bustingly difficult as a result. Alex dies if something so much as sneezes on him, platforming is floaty and imprecise as hell, Alex's punch has pathetically weak range, boss battles with Janken's henchmen are still determined totally by RNG, and the amount of lives Alex has is incredibly limited. If you play this game I'd advise turning infinite lives on, not that game overs are really that punishing anyway - they just send you to the beginning of the stage you were on. Classic Mode with all the bells, whistles & blemishes of the original should have been an extra mode. Instead the emphasis should have been on improving Alex's controls, adding actual boss fights instead of rock, paper scissors matches, allowing Alex to take some punishment before keeling over and dying, and removing all of the BS grim reaper pick-ups.",clbull,"Jun 29, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
1018,5,"Oh my do these retro reduxes give me mixed feelings. First, there’s no mistaking that the hand drawn animated look of the game is wonderful and does a fabulous job of making the classic Sega Master System game look like it belongs on a modern system. Of course you’ll have the option to switch between the classic look and the new, depending on your tastes, and this sort of feature is always a bit fascinating as you ponder over what the process looks like to reskin such an old game so thoroughly. Unfortunately, while perhaps fans of the original game may appreciate the diligence in this modern redux completely buying into the original, warts and all, as someone who wasn’t a fan of it back in the day there’s no mistaking that the gameplay is troublesome at best. Alex, for all of his punching and sometimes powered-up fury, unfortunately has a horrible glass jaw and it feels like he dies if he’s even sneezed on. Mix this with some rules that you’ll simply need to accept for how things work in general, and while I’ll credit the series with absolutely having its own take on how to handle a platform action game I’m not a fan. The result is a game I felt more like I was meant to endure than enjoy and I’d warn you to be careful when considering this title unless you’re a massive fan of the original. Even then you may still be disappointed on your return to it. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/06/mini-reviews-june-22nd-edition-nintendo.html",NindieSpotlight,"Dec 17, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch

1024,0,"I used to always laugh when people used to say companies review their own games and I thought it was a bit pointless as other reviews will catch up.  I have seen reviews here though that I just fail to believe.  Improvements to graphics and sound?  The sound is horrible.  The worst.  If the game was aimed at two year olds then great, but 2 year olds don't play games, they listen to Baby Shark, which I am sorry to say, **** all over this.Abysmal.  You know when you see a young kid listening to nursery rhymes and you think what the hell.  Why have they turned an upbeat nurseryrhyme in to the most sissified, unaudible pile of **** ever...?  Well this is the video game version of that.  It doesn't even look nice but that audio remake is a disaster.  I would rather listen to Barbie Girl on repeat than listen to this rubbish.  Thank God I played the demo.I used to have the original many years ago on Master System and I was 10 years old.  That wasn't great but was better than this by a long stretch.  Anything over 95% off in the sale and I would recommend steering clear.  Even then, I'm sure the original is on PS Now.  So you could pay £13 for a month of that and get about 700 games extra.  699 of which will be better.Oh and for good measure it didn't respond to the controls a few times too.",Phuz,"Jul 21, 2022",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch

The hit boxes are off in the new look especially the octopusses will kill you without hitting you. In the levels with tall grass everything should be elevated half a block.

1026,4,"Gráficamente no esperéis mucho, porque es un remake hecho a pixelazo. En otras palabras, es un remake de un juego de 8 bits hecho con un estilo parecido. La música no llega a ser molesta, pero no esperéis una orquesta detrás. Ahora vamos a los principales puntos negativos: 1-A día de hoy sigue teniendo bugs: Uno de ellos hace que pierdas vidas sin motivo aparente, pero posiblemente haya más aún. 2-Los controles son ortopédicos: Los saltos no son muy fluidos y es difícil medir la distancia de los golpes. Muchas veces parece que estás golpeando, pero no, y al revés. Mención especial los niveles en moto que tuve que cambiar al modo clásico para que saltara correctamente. 3- Por algún oscuro propósito a esta gente le ha parecido ""divertido"" cambiar las mecánicas de los bosses y hacerlos con una cantidad de vida insana y unas mecánicas difíciles de esquivar dados los problemas técnicos del juego y teniendo en cuenta que además de que EN ESTE JUEGO MUERES DE UN P*** GOLPE. Como puntos positivos, lo de poder cambiar la comida para que sea una tortilla de patata en lugar de una bola de arroz o una hamburguesa es un puntazo total, y lo de poder alternar entre modo clásico y el modo normal también está bien. Tras jugarlo, y haber jugado al original en su día, no sé si tuvo que haberse hecho un remake de este juego nunca.

1029,9,"Alex Kidd in Miracle World is a return to ass kickingly hard retro gaming of the 1980s. Visually it's stunning, Alex, his friends and enemies are expressive and have a wonderful Saturday morning cartoon feel to them. The new music fits the overall upbeat and joyous nature of the adventure. If you don't enjoy the new graphics, with a simple push of the button you're returned to 1986 with the original graphical style and 8-bit versions of the new tracks. The devs clearly love the original dearly as it's absolutely stuffed full of references to the series history.For example, the Janken battles in the unlockable Boss Rush mode has an audience of animals which just so happens to be a callback to ""Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle""'s Janken houses who would have this audience watch you duke it out for items. Alex's brother Prince Egle has his magic hammer as a collectible item which is a direct reference to the 1985 game Pit Pot, in which Egle was a knight who must rescue his beloved. They've clearly done their research and are huge fans.It's honestly wonderful to see such legitimate love poured into a remake as this, and I get the feeling they'd leap at the chance to make more Alex Kidd titles given the chance. Unfortunately Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX isn't perfect, and part of that is due to JankenTeam's deep respect for the original title. Whilst Alex looks and sounds incredible, the physics and hitboxes are a little too true to the original as hit detection is an issue here.Strangely this isn't such an issue with the retro graphics, but the gorgeous modern visuals don't line up nearly as well between sprite and hitbox and with Alex dying in a single touch of his opponent this can lead to some frustration, especially to new players who perhaps are less used to such oldschool game mechanics. Aside from the hit detection being skewed however there's very little to actually dislike. Alex has a plethora of items which are rare but fun to use, and despite complaints to the contrary there are actually many quality of life additions such as invisible check points to prevent players having to start  back from the beginning of the level if they should die. Even getting a game over no longer throws the player entirely out of the game and instead simply forces them back to the beginning of the level. The Janken battles have always been devisive but fortunately it's easy enough to get through these. The pattern is always the exact same and after fighting Gooseka, the very first opponent who performs this, Alex will come across an item in the next level that lets him read his opponents mind removing the chance element of the rock-paper-scissors battles entirely. I see a lot of reviews claiming the rock paper scissors matches are RNG, but it's really not. Gooseka will always throw scissors first followed by paper. Use rock followed by scissors and you'll win that fight 100% of the time without fail. As previously stated Alex Kidd is a one hit game, which means the player will die, a lot. Fortunately this is easily negated with the Infinite Lives option which makes the game far less of a headache, and allows pretty much everyone to overcome the difficulty with a little patience. Aside from the hitbox detection issues which I'd like to see get a patch for eventually, the other major issue for Miracle World DX is there isn't much to do after beating the main game.You have a boss rush mode which offers a real challenge, but the hit detection again ruins it from being perfect and a classic mode which is a recreated version of the original Alex Kidd in Miracle World title without DX's bells and whistles. Ultimately whether or not you'll find enjoyment in Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX comes down to you as a player. For the nostalgic fans who grew up with him, particularly in Europe and Australia where Alex was far more popular than he was in America, this is an absolute no brainer purchase... but for the easily frustrated or impatient gamers amongst you it's a tougher sell and it's entirely down to the hitbox detection issues. Overall I'd still recommend at least trying the game out due to the combination of obvious love poured in to the title and as a great way to test your platforming skills and finally give yourself a challenge. I personally had a great time with it and although it's short, it's amongst my favourite gaming experiences on 2021 and I can't wait to revisit and replay Miracle World again a few months down the line with fresh eyes.",FubarCharged,"Jul  5, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch

Although it is considered one of the best games of the Sega Master System, it is terribly outdated, and does not even compare to early Mario and Sonic. Alex Kidd is weak as hell, and his only attack is a very short punch, which will get you killed if the enemy runs into you first. Even the boss fights are luck based, and collecting items (the main gameplay) is a chore. For fans, it is possibly the best version of the game. For everyone who did not play the original, it is weak.",kafyasutru,"Dec 14, 2022",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
