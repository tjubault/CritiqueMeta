### 1 - Data gatherer
The first step is to get the data from metacritic website. 
Game information and reviews scores are scraped for each title of PlayStation 4, Playstation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, 3DS and Switch platforms.

### 2 - Data cleanup and preparation
Once raw data is available, we make sure it is ready to be analyzed (missing values and incorrect formats).
