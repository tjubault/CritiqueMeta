Far Cry 5: Lost on Mars,Xbox One,Ubisoft Montreal,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Arcade']",M,"Jul 17, 2018","I just finished this game and had to write a review for it. It isn't awful, and it can be enjoyable at times, but overall the experience felt like a grind that wore away at me that I was happy to put behind me. I'll start in with the good before I get into what I didn't like about it. The setting is fun, the map offers a lot for exploration and the enemies have a fun gimmick taken out of the movie Tremmors that can become quite challenging. Some of the weapons are also pretty fun to play around with, but you don't unlock those until late in the game, which is how I will lead into what I didn't like about this. What I didn't like is the grind of playing it. When you begin you just have jetpack (with very limited range) and a basic blaster pistol that won't get you far. You quickly discover how you need to slowly unlock better weapons while grinding away for currency to pay for them. Since this game is rather short (I beat it in about 4-5 hours) pretty much the entirety of your progress will be spent trying to acquire better gear. By the time you finally got all that great gear you would have loved to have while you were playing the game, it is already over and the only thing left to do is a few challenges and the final mission. In other words you never really enjoy playing this game, by the time you can finally enjoy it, it's over, and when it's over it's over. This game just abruptly ends and you just have some simple credits with a few illustrations of what could have been an ending, afterwards you just have the option to start a new game. So there you have it. This game is pretty much just a joyless grind that is over when it finally starts to get fun. I didn't even get into Hurk, who annoyed me to no end as I seemingly couldn't go a minute without him spewing some lame comments that I have heard repeatedly. I tried to see if I could mute him, no chance. Tried to see if I could dismiss him from my roster, no way. You are stuck with Hurk through the entirety of the game and he will never shut up and just talk and talk and talk endlessly throughout it. What could have been fun comic relief in small doses quickly becomes an obnoxious source of irritation that will never let up. To make matters worse the AI for his character is completely mindless, felt completely useless, and never seems to be able to do anything you want him to do. This leaves me with how I would score this thing. I said 4/10 because while it had the makings of something enjoyable the act of playing it the way you are forced to is not exactly something I particularly enjoyed. It has a lot technically wrong with it that can disrupt the experience and it felt unsatisfying in the end. This mess gets a 4/10 from me, after finishing it there is no way I would ever want to play it again, and I thought Hours of Darkness was good for playing repeatedly. This is just a lazy expansion that should have been given away for free.",0,No score yet,0,1,1,5.7,Mixed or average reviews,8,6,11

A game doesn’t need to have any dialogue tell a dramatic story, but in order for a game to be successful when trying this concept it does need to be crammed with atmosphere and immersion. FAR: Lone Sails achieves this formula well, and both the visuals and sound design shine through an unforgettable journey with a few different emotions encountered along the journey..

But sadly after Fast & Furious Crossroads released almost nobody realized that it's actually existed due to poor advertising of a game not worthy of the franchise name.

Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince,Xbox One,"Gamera Interactive, Gamera Game","['Puzzle', 'Action']",E,"Dec 12, 2017","I love it when a game surprises me in a good way and without a doubt Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince surprised me in a good way. I must admit that I didn’t expect to enjoy this game as much and the main reason I enjoyed it so much is because it got a lot of the mechanics right. The puzzles which play a massive part in the game are absolutely perfect and the clever design plays a part in each individual puzzle. They have also managed to get the difficulty spot on and by doing this it means you don’t get frustrated very often when taking on the puzzles, which is great. Another important thing in a game like this is the controls and thankfully they remain both fluid and responsive throughout, which means you can focus solely on the tasks at hand without worrying about any problems. I must admit that I was surprised with the amount of content the game offers you and without a doubt you definitely get value for money. There are 75 levels for you tackle and some of them are pretty fun, but I would have liked to have had a little more variety with the level design. I would have also liked to have had a bit more in the way of a story and I think more of a story would have made the gameplay even better. The presentation side of the game pleased me a great deal and it also has the added bonus of stirring up some fond memories, especially when it came to the visuals. The visuals in the game have a real retro look to them and they complement the gameplay ever so well. At the end of the day Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince is definitely a hidden gem. It’s a game that creates a very enjoyable experience and it makes you want to revisit time and time again, which is pretty rare with game’s like this. There is a little bit of everything in the game and this means that Fearful Symmetry will attract a number of different gamers. Also the price of the game is spot on and in a way undervalued and when it’s all said and done this game gets a massive thumbs up from me.",71,Mixed or average reviews,3,4,0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,4,0,1

Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark,Xbox One,6 Eyes Studio,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'General', 'Tactics']",T,"Apr 30, 2019","""Fell Seal: Arbiter’s Mark”Reviewed by: Elias S. LutesPublisher: 1C PublishingDeveloper: 6 Eyes StudioPlatforms: XBox One/PC/PS4 Set in a world of fantasy, this successful Kickstarter campaign has made its way to full launch on Steam, PS4, and Xbox One. Turn-based strategy games may be a dime a dozen nowadays, but none have ever been able to compare to the real gems of the genre until now. With full customization of 30 overall classes for humanoid and monster units, Fell Seal gives you the creative freedom to tailor your experience to your play style as you fight your way through a story of political intrigue that your team has fallen into purely by circumstance. The story is what I found most riveting - a game of summation, where right and wrong have clear paths and you are stuck somewhere in a grey area with Immortal gods meting out missions, and one having stepped down from his post, leaving room for one more to rise above and join the ranks. In order to be worthy of becoming an Immortal, one must of course journey on a pilgrimage across the world where rules don't seem to matter... The characters themselves are well-written, a far shot from the usual cookie-cutter protagonist/antagonist recipe one becomes used to in games of this genre. Where the development might lead, I still don't know. With hours under my belt, most of which spent grinding towards all 200 abilities available in game, I still am nowhere near finished. There is a good bit of the gameplay that old veterans will be used to -- if you've played Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or any other recent popular title, you'll be familiar with how turn order, movement, and using attacks/abilities works from the get-go. What I was not really expecting were the fantastic changes to the way items and character death worked. Character death isn't really a thing, not in the sense that the casual workings of Fire Emblem's easier modes entail, but more of a ""This guy is injured. Let him sit out, or incur a stat penalty until you do."" That penalty stacks. You will be using your items to prevent these knockouts, and rather than holding them for those ""just in case"" moments that never seem to arrive in other games, you get a set amount of items to use per fight, and these items restock afterward. This led me to actually using the items rather than ending up with a full cache like I had in Fire Emblem. (Shame on me.) When a main character is benched, it gives you ample opportunity to try out different classes you may have otherwise ignored, which really sets you on course to learn how best to set your team up for ultimate cohesion. In working with classes that meld well together, its easy to cover the weaknesses of one character with the strengths of another. Rather than reloading my saves when taking an injury for a main team member, I found myself actually looking forward to trying something new, and that's one area where this game really shines -- Yes, there's a lot of the old, but there's still so much new. Pros:- Fantastic story.- Amazing customization that will feel familiar, while still bringing so much new to the game. Cons:- I hope you like grinding.- No seriously, grinding. Overall: 9/10 As a true love-letter to Final Fantasy Tactics only could, Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark hits hard where many games have tried and failed through the decades. Opening up in a story of intense political intrigues and strife, the compelling narrative hooks you in, and reels without mercy through hours of compelling gameplay, grinding, and character customization to outfit your team as optimized as possible to completely destroy enemy parties through turn-based strategy combat. This is a must-have title, and failing to pick it up is doing yourself a disservice.",86,Generally favorable reviews,5,0,0,6.1,Mixed or average reviews,8,0,5

Feral Fury,Xbox One,Skandivania Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Top-Down']",T,"Aug 30, 2017","According to Google, the natural enemy of a Panda is the human; however, in Feral Fury you’ll face what appear to be elephants, dogs, robots, and a large selection of bugs. The game’s narrative, which is given in an all too brief cut scene at the launch of the game (the rest came from the press kit I was provided), is that after the fall of humanity, Pandas have become the dominant life form. As they are in desperate need of bamboo, they have left in search of a new planet to inhabit. You’ll take control of one of what will be many Pandas to battle the forces of evil, or good, depending on how you look at the narrative. The game is a twin stick rouge-lite adventure, very similar to the popular The Binding of Isaac; you’ll start each game or run in the same place, with a maze of rooms that change on each run. The biggest difference between the two games is the upgrade system featured here. You’ll collect blue orbs from fallen enemies which can be redeemed for perks such as extra health slots or upgrades to your weapons and abilities, which will carry over between games. If you are new to this genre, permadeath is in full force and will be experienced frequently, as Feral Fury is unforgiving, even on the easiest setting. Featuring 15 levels spread across 5 chapters, I was only able to make it to the third chapter on easy, which omits the boss fights featured in the higher difficulties. As a jab to the player, these are replaced with a room full of baby pigs that won’t attack you , and instead give you a number of additional power ups and weapons. After completing a chapter, you are given the option of progressing through a door or leaving using a Warthog-ish vehicle. The second option places you in a vehicular combat setting. I found these to be particularly frustrating, as you are only able to shoot in short bursts while waves of enemies swarm you. After a few attempts at this, I decided continuing on foot was the best course of action. The power ups offered in Feral Fury are significantly weaker than those found on the other popular rouge-lites. However, there is a large variety of them based off of the glossary in the menu. It’s important to note that while there is a wide range of guns that can be acquired, they run on ammo, unlike the pistol which is endless. These do add a strategic element, and a bad decision can come back to bite you in the ass due to the randomized nature of the game. Picking up a grenade launcher and then running into enemies that charge you is an instant death sentence. There are a number of secrets to be found if the player takes the time to explore (or reads about them online) such as attacking the store vendors, who will put up a nasty fight, but the rewards you receive for winning add a nice risk to reward aspect. In addition to these, hidden rooms can be found by blowing up explosives found in the environment as well as using your limited number of bombs. You’ll also find wishing wells that can add a curse (negative effect) or perk. Luckily, if you are cursed, most statuses are removed at the end of a level. My secret was a Galaga mini game found in an arcade room, which I was better at than the main game. In addition to the story mode, you’ll find additional difficulties and a daily run that adds 3 perks as well as a curse to your character. This mode does feature a leaderboard, so you can see where you fall within the community. I particularly enjoyed the visual style of the game, as it appears to be heavily inspired by the original Doom series, with its dark corridors and the design of the characters’ armor. Additionally, you will have to find color coded keys which resemble the old school design of the Doom keycard. You’ll be tasked with finding red keys to unlock the exit to the level and blue, which can be used to open chests or access the stores. I would recommend taking advantage of the upgrade system and buying the extra blue key upgrade early in the game, as this extra chest will greatly increase your chance for survival, especially if obtained early. While Feral Fury does lack the staying power and variety that The Binding of Isaac offers, its difficulty and replay options will keep most players busy for hours to come.",0,No score yet,1,1,0,tbd,No user score yet,1,0,0

Fimbul,Xbox One,Zaxis,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",,"Feb 28, 2019","Fimbul can become repetitive and the lack of variety in enemies within the game doesn’t help the situation. Norse mythology has featured in quite a few games over recent years and while it may not be for everybody, I personally like it. Fimbul though it has a few bright spots every now and the... it does fail to hit the mark more often than not unfortunately. That isn’t the case when it comes to the game's presentation though as both the visuals and sound designers delivered a great deal of immersion and make you become quite attached to the story that’s being un-folded. The story I found to be interesting the entire play through and while more depth would’ve been nice the story is still one of the main reasons why I continued my journey. Continuing was rather difficult though because you have to contend with lots of technical issues along the way. The issues when combined with the repetitiveness of the gameplay make you forget about the game’s decent combat elements, which is too bad, because the combat does have a surprising amount of depth to it even if it doesn’t challenge you quite enough. All that said, Fimbul is one of those games that tends to take one step forward and two steps back because anything good the game delivers to you is quickly lost due to the lack of overall polish. I can’t give Fimbul a full recommendation because the problems that are present just take too much away from the enjoyment of the game overall.",0,No score yet,0,2,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0

While Final Fantasy X is a turn-based RPG, with a mixture of exploration and random battles the we have come to remember the series roots of many classic Final Fantasy games offered to us by Square Enix over the years. Playing as Tidus an athlete living in the metropolis of Zanarkand. You will witness your home being destroyed by an enormous mythical creature called Sin and then wake 1000 years in the future. Sin has terrorized the world of Spira in cycles ever since. Even once Sin is destroyed it eventually comes back, and the religious factions of Spira are convinced that the people’s indiscretions are largely the reason why. You join a pilgrimage with a summoner Yuna along with her guardians and friends to destroy Sin yet once again to bring peace to Spira once more. While Final Fantasy X-2 is a direct sequel it is set by a much lighter story in a freshly liberated Spira where you instead take on the role of Yuna. While it’s a very different game with a revamped combat system at your disposal, X-2 features a turn based combat system that runs in a ""real-time"" manner although you have the ability to slow the real time clock. Instead of seven characters, you control only three this time around. Customization instead comes in the form of ""dresspheres"", which are essentially 20 different classes you can swap amongst on the fly. You build loadouts of ""dresspheres"" using a system referred to as the garment grid, which offers plenty of flexibility during battle as long as you’ve planned accordingly for the variety of scenarios. Timing it right allows you to chain attacks for higher damage as well. Both are excellent remasters and well executed for the Xbox One. This collection will keep any Square Enix fan busy reliving the epic journeys at hand or enjoying them for the first time in their remastered glory. The price of admission is a little high however for these remasters compared to the other recent remasters made for Xbox fans, however as we have seen in the past Square is always good at offering sales on their games to allow for everyone to eventually add these little gems to their Xbox gaming libraries.

From bobbers to bottom Rigs, you'll want to go grab your folding chair and drag it to your TV. With Tons of Rods and reels, Hundreds of bait and lure options, and over a hundred kinds of fish to catch, this is one of the most complete fishing games to date! Start off small with a simple rod, a bobber, and some bait, and work your way to fishing holes around the world. With a steep learning curve and several ways to fish the dozens of species, this game can keep you reeling for hours on end. The right Rod and Reel, with the right tackle, to catch the right fish, Fishing Planet has fishing to a science. The fish you pull up are nearly photo quality real, and you can even take a good look at them on your line. Pulling up my first fish with fight was a treat, just like landing that fish in real life, you just don't get to take it home and fry it up. The game isn't slow, It's fishing, but it is a bit tedious, and grindy. Everything costs in-game currency, bait, hardware, tackle, and travel will all have their price tags. How do you supplement these expenditures? You Fish! This game is not for everyone, if you don't like to go fishing, you likely won't enjoy this game. Personally I enjoy fishing, to the point that I've put hours into other games with fishing mechanics, just to fish.

Fishing Sim World,Xbox One,Dovetail Games,"['Sports', 'Individual', 'Nature', 'Fishing']",E,"Sep 18, 2018","The fishing mechanics have quite a bit of realism included in them which means catching certain fish is a very rewarding experience. There is a decent amount of variety present when it comes to the locations you can visit and this does make the game have some replay value. I really liked that you’re able to buy all of the fishing gear straight away instead of unlocking it because it keeps grinding down to a minimum. Each lake has character and fishing on them is a very relaxing and sometimes exciting experience. The game has a few bugs at the moment and whilst none of them are really major they can impact on your overall experience at times. I found the controls to be a little awkward most of the time and they didn’t always feel as tight and responsive as they should’ve been. There isn’t anything really wrong with the presentation side of the game there isn’t really anything that stands out either. Fishing game’s are niche in my opinion and I don’t know many people that really enjoy these types of game’s. Thankfully though I do enjoy them because I find them relaxing and peaceful and it takes me back to being a kid because I used to fish with my dad a lot when I was younger. As you can imagine then I did have some interest in Fishing Sim World and after playing it for a while I realised that it’s not a bad game at all, but it still does have a few shortcomings. Without a doubt my favourite thing about this game was its fishing mechanics and the reason why it was my favourite thing is because the mechanics had a nice realistic feel to them. I also liked the idea of being able to fish at a number of different locations and thankfully these locations have been done well even if the presentation side of the game is a little lacking at times. This however isn’t a big issue and when they sort out the awkward controls then I can see this being a game that I return to time and time again and for that reason the game does enough to get a recommendation because I personally love fishing games.",71,Mixed or average reviews,2,4,0,tbd,No user score yet,1,0,0

Fission Superstar X gained my attention almost immediately because it had a look to it that was very unique, but was the gameplay as unique as its presentation? Yes it is, because it features a number of different mechanics you wouldn’t expect in this genre and the most impressive thing is that these different mechanics work extremely well together. Fission Superstar X is a side-scrolling shooter and a challenging side-scrolling shooter,  so expect a challenge each time you begin a new run. The challenge then can become overbearing early on while you gain familiarity in the game, so you may encounter a slight frustration on occasion. Fission Superstar X does assist by offering a huge amount of effective weapons to defeat the amount of challenging enemies and for the most part each weapon feels like it matters and is not there just for show. The content of the game has enough to keep you coming back hungry for each new run. Fission Superstar X may be very difficult and not have much of a story, but what it does well is provide an experience that’s fun and worthwhile at the same time. If you enjoy side-scrolling shooters like I do, then this game deserves a place in your Xbox One gaming library, because it’s unique in a number of different ways and gets many things very right, and some slightly wrong.",69,Mixed or average reviews,2,2,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0

Flutter Bombs,Xbox One,"Earthborn Interactive, LLC","['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Top-Down']",,"Apr 12, 2019","Flutter bombs really impressed me at the start as a huge fan of twin stick shooters, but the longer I played I wanted more from the game and was quite disappointed in the length of the game outside of the achievement to hunt down. The butterflies and insects theme was quite cool but the lack of feeling a real difference in my gameplay fell short as I unlocked each new skin and the strengths behind it. At its core this game is a top-down twin-stick shooter and while it isn’t the best game I’ve ever played in this genre it’s still a game that provides you with a lot of fun and enjoyable moments. The game has a good difficulty setting for the general public but leave the true twin stick fan unchallenged. While you don’t really get frustrated you will still find it to get a little repetitive though especially if played on your own so I recommend that you take control of your butterfly in co-op to have some pure mayhem and fun with others..  Flutter Bombs may lack in a few areas but it definitely still gets more right than it gets wrong and if you’re looking for a fun yet simple twin-stick shooter then you can easily do worse than this game. It's priced fairly and overall not a bad game it is just missing a bit of wow factor. That being said I still recommend it as there is plenty of fun and challenging achievements in game to keep you coming back for more.",0,No score yet,0,2,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,2,0

The game controls can get confusing for non flyer type gamers. i feel that the graphics are a 8/10 because of the face that it looks similar to a flight  simulator when you are in first person mode but overall i would love to give the game a 8/10 beacuse of the face that the game features planes that are no longer used in modern day times and the feel of flying and using an old fighter jet and or bomber is really nice! the story concept of the game is 10/10 script wise and you feel like you are the pilot with how some of the dialog goes in the stoy campaign mode! Now for the multiplayer aspect of the game could use a but work was kind of difficult to find out how to ing people to play it with and some of the options to host a multiplayer lobby was kinda good, but as I said before trying to invite other players was a but difficult to do. So my overal oppinion of your game is 9/10. Why such high rating well I am a fan of flyers and well your game was very indept on how it was presented to the masses, its fun even children under 15 I would recomend it for them to play because of the game play, storytelling, and not much inappropriate things displayed by that i mean none at all it's a good and wonderful game that should be rated E for everyone.

Football Game,Xbox One,Cloak and Dagger Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",T,"Nov  6, 2019","Ratalaika Games always releasing titles that are simple, fun, and great for Achievement/Trophy hunters and “Football game’ is no different. It is inspired by 80’s and 90’s point in clicks, and it accomplishes this nicely. It really feels, and looks like a classic point and click. it also has some really nice and modern additions to it as well. I love this about the games Ratalaika has been delivering. They really provide affordable retro games that most people are really enjoying while padding those gamer stats. This might not be their best port to date, but it’s certainly still a really well developed title.You play as Tommy a local football hero in the small town of East Bend USA. You are trying to find your girlfriend Suzy at the game in the Bleachers of the Purchase County Turbines. You will meet a really interesting group of characters from your mother, foes, and friends. They all have really unique dialogues, and pull you into the story, make you laugh, and some will even piss you off. It delivers on all retro point and click fronts, even while being a very short game. I’d say you can complete it without a walk through in under a hour. With a walk through in probably under thirty minutes. Yes kind of short, but for 5 dollars still worth the pad in stats, and evening of good times.One my favorite things is the music. The artist Jupiter-C really grabbed my attention. I’m now a fan after this, and started listening to a ton of their other music and it is really great. They have a nice Alternative style that really fits into this game really well. The game being 80’s/90’s inspired and also kind of dark and twisted it really adds to the games vibes. I can honestly say they probably wouldn’t have delivered the message as well without the soundtrack. the music alone in my opinion is worth the 5 dollars you will spend for this.I really liked the look of the game it took me back to those point and clicks, but also offered a lot more.I enjoyed some of the modern looking cut scenes, and regular scenes they threw in there. A lot of people might be turned off by this. I know a lot of gamers today are all about the graphics and things looking real. I love the fact though a lot of these retro looking games are making a come back. Modern console makers have really accepted the Indie developer and in a lot of cases this Gen they have delivered the best games. I can go on and on about all the great Indies this Gen, and I love it. Most these AAA devs releasing games unfinished, and need patched over and over while these Indie devs releasing great content that works perfectly day one. Amazing stories and adventures, at great prices and I’m glad to have been a gamer in this time period. “Football Game” might not be one of the great Indies of this time, but it’s without question a quality title. It’s certainly another Ratalaika Game worth adding to your collection. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and I enjoyed the pad to my gaming stats. I also discovered another really cool bad to add to my playlist so I’m excited to have had the chance to review “Football Game” If you’ve played it let me know what you thought about it. There below is a link below to our video review if you want to see some game footage.Also just to see who is paying attention I'm hiding a announcement below that we now have an official page ;) it isn't done or even ready, but you can watch it come together. Pros:Amazing SoundtrackCool CharactersEasy AchievementsDark and Haunting StoryAffordable Cons:Really Short StoryHad issues with Save menus Overall; 7.1A retro point and click that offers a night of entertaining storytelling while padding your stats, and maybe even introducing you to some new music and game styles.",0,No score yet,0,1,1,tbd,No user score yet,0,2,0

Without a doubt Forsaken has never looked and sounded better and whilst it isn’t perfect I appreciate the effort that has gone into the presentation. It was really fun revisiting this game again because the gameplay is as fun as ever and it’s definitely aged well despite it being year’s old. Back in the day I found this game to be pretty frustrating at times, but thankfully I didn’t get as frustrated this time around because this version feels much more fair.There is a decent amount of content for you to get to grips with and it will no doubt keep fans of the game satisfied for quite a while. I found that the game wasn’t as difficult as it was back in the day it’s still quite difficult and this high difficulty may be off-putting for some. Unfortunately the game is missing a few items which were in the N64 version and it would’ve been nice to have seen these items included. Does Forsaken Remastered do enough to get a recommendation from me? I was really excited to learn that Forsaken was getting a remaster and I bet I wasn’t the only one either because the original has quite a big following. Thankfully if like me you loved the original then I’m pretty certain that you’ll love this remaster because you can tell almost immediately that this game has had a lot of thought and effort placed into a number of areas and without a doubt this for me is the best version of the game because even though it’s missing a few items it plays better than ever and in a way it’s breathed new life into a game which is of course a bonafide classic.",0,No score yet,2,1,0,tbd,No user score yet,1,0,0

Fossil Hunters,Xbox One,Reptoid Games,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",E,"Sep 12, 2018","The presentation side of the game is packed to the rafters with charm because both the visuals and sound design combine together perfectly. There are decent amount of levels for you to get to grips with and each level has a lot of variety and different challenges to keep things fresh. I really enjoyed the gameplay because it had a number of interesting mechanics in play at the same time and each mechanic added something different to the game. This game is accessible to a number of different gamers and playing the game in local co-op delivers quite a lot in terms of fun and enjoyable moments. It can be fun when playing on your own it does get repetetive quite quickly when played this way.Unfortunately the game doesn’t offer you any online components which is a shame because an inclusion of an online mode would’ve given the game replayability. There isn’t lots of content for you to get to grips with which makes the game a tad overpriced in my opinion. Fossil Hunters is a game that the Xbox One doesn’t really have and its uniqueness caught my eye immediately. Thankfully this uniqueness shines in a number of areas and on the whole the game was really fun, especially when I played with my children in local co-op. You can also play the game on your own as well but I would recommend that you play it with somebody else because it does get repetetive quite quickly when played in solo. Even though it does get repetetive after a while it still didn’t stop me from returning back to the game time and time again. The main reason why it kept me coming back for more is because digging up fossils is interesting and very addictive and the reason it’s addictive is because there are a number of different mechanics in play at the same time. This then means that I would’ve liked a little more content because you can blow through the game quite quickly and for me there just isn’t enough of it. That being said Fossil Hunters still does more than enough to get a recommendation from me because it creates fun and enjoyable moments for gamers of all ages.",0,No score yet,0,0,1,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0

FoxyLand,Xbox One,BUG-Studio,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",,"Nov 26, 2019","Foxy Land is a platformer where you play as a Fox named Foxy and your trying to rescue your girlfriend Jennie. She is swooped away by a bird , and you must jump into action to save her. Your adventure will carry you through 36 levels full of traps, and even 4 bonus Halloween levels. The idea of the game is to get every jewel on the level to open the doors to the next one. There are also cherries on the level to collect to purchase cosmetic items for your character. All kinds of really cool items like pants, hats, and so on. You start with three hearts, so you can only get hit twice. If you get hit a third you will die., and have to start the level over. each time you get hit you will drop cherries, but you can rush to collect them back up.The levels can be challenging towards the end. They are full of puzzles, traps, and hidden switches. There are even levels where a spike wall chases you so you must rush to collect the jewels. The traps are made up of darts, spikes, huge crushing stones, breakaway floors, and so much more. It will really make you work in the later levels if you don't take your time. I found myself rushing early to get the levels done, but paid for it later on. The Achievements are really easy, and fast to collect. You get them for collecting a certain amount of cherries, buying a item, passing a 5, 10,15, and 20 levels, and even dying. It probably only takes about 10 minutes to collect them all so for all your Achievement hunters this is a must grab. At $4.99 you can't pass up on padding those gamer stats.I love Ratalaika's indie retro collection they are bringing to this generation of consoles, I really hope they are right there night holiday season for the next. The games really look and feel like the ones we loved in the 8 and 16 bit generations. The music does the same they do such an amazing job and porting the quality modern retros to consoles, and have released many of games I've just adored. even after collecting the achievements for them I have had a hard time putting them down and just went ahead and completed them. If you love old school games, and haven't heard of them I recommend checking them out. If your an Achievement hunter, and don't know these guys you certainly need to be grabbing up their titles really gonna add to that score. Pros:Loved the challenge of Puzzles and platformingReally fun retro music and lookAwesome cosmetics to unlock for characterEasy , easy Achievements and trophies Cons:Short GameNot a ton of replay value after unlocking everything Overall: 7.3 A really awesome modern retro title with easy achievement hunting, and challenging game play. Another one of those Ratalaika titles that will give you a great evening of fun alone or with the family.",0,No score yet,0,1,1,tbd,No user score yet,0,2,0

The game is exceptionally basic, however can get more earnestly for a couple of the levels the player goes over, however it never wanders excessively far from the known Ratalaika Games publishing style we have all come to know and enjoy. The start of the game is basic and shows the player how to move around as a spaghetti noodle. The lone controls to stress over are maneuvering your noodle with the left switch stick and utilizing either the guards or triggers to move Freddy the spaghetti.

There are five arrangements of worlds, each wold containing ten levels for every territory. Freddy's objective is basic, you get him to the featured blue or red entries without him facing damage or doom. Various sorts of threat come as individual enemies that pursue you, or you falling. I only found a few of the more challenging levels to be frustrating as you must leap from platforms over pits for example. Freddy Spaghetti joins the always well known distraught cap physical science ongoing interaction with a similarly extraordinary story and level set up. A portion of the levels feel an excess of like tutorials, and the idea of the interactivity can prompt a couple of occurrences. Overall this is a surprisingly fun and value packed title.

Dive deep into the ocean around reefs and shipwrecks to catch the biggest fish hiding in the depths, but be careful, Sharks frequent these same hunting grounds too! The Graphics and ambient sound create a very relaxing environment for fishing in. The game has a near Zen feeling over about 90% gameplay. The only issue I had was with the fighting physics, they're clunky, to say the least. Like most competitive sport hunting games, you advance by defeating the local fisher. Once the local Pro has been beaten then you can fish the area for fun and money. Use this money to upgrade your gear, making most aspects of the game easier per upgrade. Some upgrades will help you stay underwater longer, others give you better range, accuracy or speed. If the fighting physics were fixed or changed, the game would be nearly flawless.

Frost,Xbox One,Stage Clear Studios,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Card Battle']",E,"Jul 20, 2018","I must admit that I do have a soft spot for deckbuilding game’s but I can also understand why some people don’t like them as well because some game’s of this ilk don’t feature much action and instead feature tons of frustration. Frost the new deckbuilding game that’s made its way to the Xbox One thankfully does feature quite a bit of action and not too much frustration and without a doubt as far as the deckbuilding genre goes it’s definitely one of the best the genre has to offer. In a way Frost is unique compared to other game’s of this ilk and the main reason why it’s unique is because the gameplay features a hybrid of different genre’s. These different genre’s in the game combine together really well and when in full flow the game can be pretty fun and exciting at the same time. I would however still recommend that you play the game in short bursts though because despite it being fun and having a decent amount of content for you to get to grips with it can still get repetetive quite quickly. The game can also be a little too difficult as well and I even found it to be quite difficult on the easy setting as well. That being said I still didn’t find my frustration levels getting too high and I think that was mainly down to the strategy elements in the game. Strategy obviously plays a big part in this game and I’m pleased to say that it works well throughout even if there is a lot of randomness present. The randomness is a little bit of a problem at times but I found when competing against the randomness if I managed to win by some good strategy moves I got a great sense of achievement, which is always good. One of the main reasons why I think people don’t like game’s of this ilk is due to the complicated nature of them, but that’s not the case when it comes to Frost. If you’re not feeling confident within the game then you can always check out the game’s excellent tutorial. As far as tutorials go Frost has one of the best because it explains everything in very good detail and without a doubt after playing the tutorial you definitely feel more confident approaching the main game. People who love lots of different things going on in the presentation side of things may be a little disappointed here, but thankfully I enjoyed the simplistic approach they went with in both the visuals and sound design. At the end of the day if like me you have a soft spot for deckbuilding game’s then you definitely have to try out Frost. It’s a game that gets the important aspects spot on and whilst it has a few imperfections it still delivers to you a fun and engaging experience.",0,No score yet,0,1,2,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0
Frostpunk: Console Edition,Xbox One,11 bit studios,"['Strategy', 'Action Adventure', 'Management', 'Survival', 'Government']",M,"Oct 11, 2019","Я не очень понимаю почему так мало стратегий в реальном времени или градостроительных симуляторов, как вам угодно, адаптировано на консолях? Неужели так сложно довести до ума и дать любителям массовых застроек насладиться этим прекрасным жанром, управляя процессами джойстиком, а не клавиатурой с мышью? Вот поляки из 11 bit studios, как по мне, прекрасно справились с задачей переноса своего детища на приставки текущего поколения. Итак, о Frostpunk поподробнее. Наша главная миссия в игре выжить в условиях суровых морозов. Существуем мы в альтернативной реальности в 1886 году где солнце постепенно затухает и мир погружается в вечную зиму. Вокруг сердца города - огромного генератора, работающего на угле и соответственно согревающего людей и дающего тепло и энергию всем постройкам, возводим город. Видов ресурсов у нас немного - это уголь, древесина, сталь, сырая еда, пищевые пайки и паровые ядра. Главные для выживания ресурсы это конечно уголь для поддержания необходимого тепла и пищевые пайки, которые изготавливаются из сырой пищи, для того, чтобы наши горожане были всегда сыты. Прочие ресурсы необходимы для строительства всевозможных зданий, изучения новшеств и экспедиций. Помимо всего прочего необходимо следить за шкалой недовольства и надежды, каждая из них очень важна, так как в случае накопившегося недовольства или полностью угасшей надежды нас незамедлительно выставляют на мороз, после чего все придётся начинать сначала. Воздействуем на наших жителей прежде всего за счёт удовлетворения текущих нужд и принятия законов. Очень рекомендую начать играть для начала в бесконечном режиме, который не так суров к игроку и дает возможность понять все нюансы, ибо сюжетная часть весьма беспощадна и не терпит ошибок, исправить их будет очень сложно. В Frostpunk присутствуют четыре сценария: Новый дом - основная большая сюжетная ветка, Ковчеги, Беженцы и Падение Винтерхоума. Каждая история ставит перед нами свои задачи и в общем и целом они достаточно разные. Если в Новом доме мы с нуля отстраиваем город и готовимся к грандиозной буре, которую соответственно надо пережить. Хотя надо ещё до этой самой бури дожить, а это, скажу я вам, весьма и весьма непросто в виду постоянно валящихся проблем, с которыми едва успеваешь справляться как на очереди их уже вдвое больше. В кампании Ковчеги, к слову, самой миролюбивой к игроку, кажется это единственная кампания, где у меня никто не умер, нам необходимо поддерживать определенную температуру в трёх оранжереях, где хранятся чуть ли не последние на земле растения и семена. Это великолепный градостроительный симулятор со своей тяжелой и захватывающей историей. Бесповоротные рекомендации для тех кто понимает.",84,Generally favorable reviews,8,1,0,8.2,Generally favorable reviews,39,9,4

Fruit Ninja Kinect 2,Xbox One,Halfbrick Studios,"['General', 'Action', 'Arcade']",E,"Mar 18, 2015","If you liked the regular Fruit Ninja modes those are still there. You have the mode of if you miss three fruit and/or slice three bombs you’ll lose. Another mode is just time based bombs are still there but you don’t lose, there’s just a delay in the fruit appearing. The third “Classic” mode is zen mode where again is time based but there are no bombs. There are four new single player modes that you can choose from in the “Festival” menu. Each new mode has a new character to introduce the new mode. Katsuro’s Ninja Dodge Dodge is a mode where shurikens are being thrown at you while slicing as much fruit as you can. More and faster shurikens are thrown as you successfully dodge more and more. Mari’s Strawberry Stealth puts your Ninja skills to the test by slicing fruit while avoiding moving spotlights. Being spotted sounds the alarm and points are lost the longer you stay in the spotlight. So if your shoulder just seen for a split second, less points are lost than if you do your best deer in a headlight impression and just stand there. Nobu’s Bamboo Strike is a mode where you have to slice the bamboo seeds before they hit the ground. Miss one and bamboo will grow to block you from slicing fruit. Han’s Apple Range is probably my favorite new mode. You have to throw knives at fruit instead of slice them. There are targets that pop down that you have to hit with your knives. Fruit Ninja 2 is $14.99 on the Xbox Store. In my opinion that’s a little pricey for a game that doesn’t have too much content. You can unlock all the game-modes in the matter of 15 minutes. Just like many Kinect games you can work up a bit of a sweat.  If you liked the first Fruit Ninja on the Xbox 360 you’ll like the new Fruit Ninja Kinect 2.",69,Mixed or average reviews,3,8,0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,7,2,2

Full Metal Furies,Xbox One,Cellar Door Games,"['Action', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", '2D']",E10+,"Jan 17, 2018","Full Metal Furies is a game that I’ve been looking forward to for quite a while and thankfully it didn’t disappoint. The developers have made the game very fun and addictive and most important of all is it’s very rewarding, which is great. In the game there are four characters for you to try out and trying them out was very fun. Each character has had a lot of thought and effort put into them and the variety each character has keeps things fresh throughout. The gameplay on the whole is super addictive and has loads of interesting concepts in play at the same time. You would expect the gameplay to be complicated because of this, but thankfully they keep things simple which makes the game accessible to a lot of gamers. Whilst it may be simple in its approach it does however get a tad too difficult at times and the difficulty seems to spike out of nowhere which can be a little frustrating at times. Thankfully though the progression system makes you forget about the difficulty and makes you determined to carry on. I say this because the progression system has been done to perfection and the best thing is that it delivers you tons of replay value. Those who are fans of the strategy side of game’s may be a little disappointed here because there isn’t much in terms of variety here unfortunately. Something that really surprised me about the game though was how fun and charming the story was. The story remains interesting throughout and the way they tell the story has a unique feel to it, which is great. The presentation side of the game ticked a lot of boxes for me and I was especially fond of the visuals. The pixel-art visuals fit the game’s style very well and the accompanying sound design also holds up really well. At the end of the day I love it when a game reaches my lofty expectations and thankfully that’s exactly what Full Metal Furies does. You can tell from the get go that a lot of love and effort has gone into the game and this makes everything about the game stand out in a good way. It’s both fun and addictive when playing on your own or with friends and the simplicity of the game means things never get too frustrating, which is something that I really liked, and without a doubt Full Metal Furies gets a massive thumbs up from me.",75,Generally favorable reviews,6,1,0,6.4,Mixed or average reviews,6,0,3

Fumiko!,Xbox One,Fumiko Game Studio,"['Action', 'Platformer', '3D']",T,"Feb 23, 2018","Fumiko! is a game like no other and it has unique elements running throughout the game, which in turn means the enjoyment levels can be off the charts at times. I thought I’d seen it all with games over the years, but Fumiko! makes you realise that you definitely haven’t and this without a doubt is the game’s biggest selling point. I didn’t expect there to be much in terms of a story, but surprisingly there was and guess what it was fantastic. The story managed to keep me invested throughout and that’s very impressive because the game has a good length to it. The world in which the game takes place in is absolutely stunning and when you explore it gets even better because there’s plenty for you to find. Whilst exploring is absolutely brilliant I did however have a few problems with the camera. The camera can be very awkward at times and it can be difficult getting it in the place that you want so expect a little bit of frustration here. There are a number of levels for you to sink your teeth into in this game and the level design in each level is great. Every level has tons of variety going for it and without a doubt you can tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into the levels. In terms of the gameplay everything feels great and the platforming elements feel solid throughout. I had a great deal of fun jumping around trying to complete the levels and the very good controls keep the fun factor very high. Whilst the gameplay is extremely fun it can however be extremely difficult at times so expect to get stuck from time to time and that will cause you some frustration but it never seems to get out of hand, which is always a good thing. The presentation side of the game is some of the best I’ve ever experienced in a game. Visually the game is weird and wonderful at the same time and everything stands out in a good way. The same can also be said about the sound design which makes things become immersive flawlessly. At the end of the day if you’re somebody who’s bored of the same things and you’re desperate to try something new then look no further than Fumiko! . It’s a game that tries to think outside the box and the most impressive thing is that it doesn’t have many shortcomings, which means the game stays unique and enjoyable throughout and this means the game gets a massive recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,1,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,1,0,0

Future War:Reborn,Xbox One,Good net technology co. Ltd,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'Third-Person', 'Arcade']",T,"Dec 20, 2017","We’ve seen quite a few mobile game’s come to consoles recently and most of them haven’t been very good, and unfortunately Future War: Reborn doesn’t set the world alight either. I will say however that this is not the worst mobile ported game I’ve ever played and it does have some good points. The gameplay in the game is actually pretty decent and it does provide some enjoyable moments, but unfortunately it’s very brief. You will notice that the amount of content is pretty lacklustre and there isn’t much replay value to be had here, which will put a lot of people off because the price tag is a little too high for the content you get. There are not many levels for you to get to grips with and that’s probably a good thing because the level design is severely lacking when it comes to variety. There is also a shortage of variety when it comes to the enemies and facing them does become tedious which is a shame because I thought the weapons were pretty fun to use. Something they did get right though was the controls that were implemented. When using these controls you would never think that this game started off on mobile devices because they’ve done a brilliant job of making the controls smooth and responsive throughout. The presentation side of the game is not the best and you can tell straight away that there has been little effort to make it different from the mobile port. Visually the game looks ugly most of the time and there isn’t really much that’s memorable. The sound design doesn’t do much better and in the end it just ends up getting on your nerves. At the end of the day in order to make a mobile port become successful on a console you have to tweak little things to make it look like it belongs on console and in some ways they do get some things right, but unfortunately they also get a lot wrong. Future War: Reborn is a game that’s overpriced in my opinion and I think if they’d have started with a lower price out of gate then the problems wouldn’t have been as glaring. When it’s all said and done this game does provide you with some enjoyable moments but the problems are never far behind so for that reason I can’t fully recommend this game to you.",41,Generally unfavorable reviews,0,2,3,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0
