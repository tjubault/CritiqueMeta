Still, if you want the nostalgia trip or for some reason aren’t satisfied with the near-bottomless list of more interesting RPGs on the Switch, it may be worth the punt. We’d give this one a light recommendation, then, but would say you’re better off picking up the remasters of Final Fantasy XII or Shin Megami Tensei III if you’re looking for a worthwhile sixth-generation RPG.

Seven-plus years on and that formula feels suitably refreshed on Switch with a tougher set of challenges, a better course unlock system and support for local co-op. 10 Second Run Returns might look basic, but there’s plenty of addictive fun and moreish frustration to be had in 10 seconds or less.",Nintendo Life,"Jan 31, 2018",10 Second Run Returns,Switch

It is just a shame that the thrill I had during the first few hours, didn’t carry over into the later hours of the game, as it does get a tad repetitive as you make your way through. Having said that, I didn’t feel like I ever wanted to stop playing. Every time I died, I just had to have one more go.

100,"13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is lengthy and complex, particularly if you really want to understand every little nuance of the story. The story might not feature player agency, as it has no branching choices or bad endings (and I’d argue that this is a strength of the game, that it’s determined to tell one story and tell it well) but even then the narrative alone will take at least fifteen hours to see to the end. Add on a few hours of the strategy RPG and you’ve got a hefty title on your hands. Ultimately though, I stuck through with 13 Sentinels because it’s paced immaculately – the mystery of the narrative gets its hooks into you and rushes you through an intricate web of conspiracy, discovery, and self-reflection. It got me to laugh, to gasp, and to view the world differently. We talk a lot about the potential of interactive storytelling to deliver experiences beyond film or print, and yet not many games do – but here is Vanillaware making it look effortless.

While I was hoping that Vanillaware would go back and add in a couple of new scenes that they had previously cut out of the game, I will also happily take the changes to Destruction mode. Now that a Switch version is available, I am hoping more people will get to experience this masterpiece of modern gaming. 13 Sentinels flew under the radar on PS4, so now I'm hoping the spotlight will be on this excellent game after word of mouth has spread.

In confidently sticking to its unconventional ideas, it may alienate some. However, those who connect with it are in for a wonderful time.

That's for the best, as 13 Sentinels remains one of the most intriguing releases in recent years and a game that's been slept on by a large number of people turned off by its anime or mecha-inspired origins.

It’s the kind of game that’ll have you wishing that you could play it again for the first time, just so all its best elements could be new again. We’d give 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim a strong recommendation, then, to anyone who has even a passing interest in visual novels.

A Vita version was originally planned before the game was delayed so much that the idea of releasing a new game on Sony’s dying handheld was laughable. Because of that, this version feels like 13 Sentinels is finally where it was meant to be all along.

The visual novel adventure gameplay translates almost perfectly to a handheld format, and I found it to be more fun to pick up and play in short spurts versus needing to park myself in front of a TV. Even the more obscured mecha combat work well in a handheld format. The gameplay and story still feel fresh and engaging, and those who've already finished it once might find something to enjoy here.

While we're sure many people will consider the game's shortness a cardinal sin, we'd still recommend you give it a try if you're a fan of '80s and '90s gaming, appreciate lush 2D artwork and desire an experience which firmly lodges itself in your consciousness – even if it doesn't last all that long.",Nintendo Life,"Jan 20, 2020",198X,Switch

Even so, we can’t deny that having games recovered from decades ago is always a welcome surprise, and for that, we are more than pleased to salute the addition of this one to the Nintendo Switch's ever-growing, ever-impressive shmup library.

Megaman games have always been incredibly challenging and anything that tries to give the same feel as those needs to be just as difficult. 20XX does an incredible job of balancing this given its roguelike nature.

After dying we’d often suffer from that 'just one more run' itch that’s so common in roguelikes and the formula fits an action platformer like 20XX perfectly.

80,"’80s Overdrive comes to the Switch in top form and stands even taller on the hybrid console than it did on the 3DS three years ago. With games like the original arcade great Outrun and other modern games like Horizon Chase Turbo that it inspired, it would be easy to get lost in the shuffle, but it doesn’t. It stands out thanks to a bright visual style and a memorable soundtrack that makes use of some of the best ’80s-infused music you could ask for. It controls like a dream and even the original version’s touchscreen support is retained for menus to make things easier to navigate.

The novelty doesn’t last long and it becomes an exercise in patience having to relearn control schemes while navigating unfairly placed traps. It’s compelling to find each character’s inner strengths but it can also get repetitive thanks to the uninspired stage layouts. Indeed, 88 Heroes is an example of quantity over quality. I like the premise but wish there were more specialized challenges that took the heroes’ unique powers into account or levels that incorporated the powers as opposed to succumbing to a generic one-size fits all design.

There's a lot of personality to every aspect of its presentation, and the heroes themselves are fantastic fun to mess around with, so it's just a shame that it falls a little short overall.

Let’s hope the planned fixes elevate the game even more.",NintendoWorldReport,"Mar  8, 2018",A Hole New World,Switch
60,"A Hole New World is a decent enough retro platforming experience, but it’s short, and doesn’t stand out from the pack. The First Press Games collector’s edition looks tasty, though.",Switch Player,"Oct 30, 2019",A Hole New World,Switch
60,"A competent and authentic 8-bit experience, A Hole New World will be enjoyed by many a retro fan out there, but the some of its mechanical elements are faithful almost to its detriment. Travelling between the dual worlds is cool, but utilised without much ambition or variety. While certainly not a bad game, the methods employed to enforce difficulty feel cheap and frustrating, rather than motivating or rewarding. A few of the bosses are visually impressive, but there isn't much here structurally or gameplay wise that particularly stand out . If you're looking for another title with more nostalgia and 'traditional' challenge rather than sadistic, fast-paced, twitch-based platformers, then A Hole New World is an adequate game that will bring back many memories of the 8-bit era, for better or worse.",Nintendo Life,"Mar  5, 2018",A Hole New World,Switch
85,"Overall A Juggler’s Tale is a very neat experience with fantastic aesthetic presentation, a fantastic medieval style soundtrack, and a heartwarming but simple story to tell. The only real issue I experienced were some readability problems when it came to figuring out what certain puzzles expected of me, but I was always able to figure it out on my own in the end. A playthrough goes quickly, only lasting around two to three hours, so it doesn’t overstay its welcome nor does it feel too brief. If you enjoy a good puzzle platformer, A Juggler’s Tale is a worthy addition to your collection, no strings required.",NintendoWorldReport,"Sep 30, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
80,"A Juggler’s Tale isn’t a long game, it will only take you a few hours to complete. However, its length is refreshing in a time where we are surrounded by massive open-world games that can leave us exhausted just by looking at their playtime. Abby is a joy to play as, and though she doesn’t say a word and is sometimes taunted by the narrator, her story resonates through the way she survives and thrives in a world that wants to keep her grounded and tied up. The way that you can literally feel the weight in her strings adds a layer of empathy for the protagonist and makes you realise how strong-willed she really is. Though she is small in stature and doesn’t look like she’d be strong, this puppet’s tale will make you realise that strength comes in all sizes, even in the shape of a little marionette whose only real talent is juggling.",Checkpoint Gaming,"Oct 19, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
70,"A Juggler’s Tale is a polished title, delivering a smooth gameplay flow that’s over too quickly for its launch price. Anyone can appreciate the visual presentation and voiced story. Meanwhile, enthusiasts will enjoy the blend of puzzles (albeit easy ones) and action. It’s a unique game in many ways and one that leaves an impression. But, it also leaves you wanting more. I hope to cheer on Abby in a sequel, one whose price better matches its length.",Pure Nintendo,"Oct  8, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
65,"Without showing any great singularity, A Juggler's Tale stands out with a beautiful atmosphere, a few nicely sketched sets and a handful of well-thought-out puzzles. But the lack of comfort felt during the crossing lacks an experience that is a bit too short and generic to really score. With better handling and some additional originalities, the game could have been a real success. Pity.",Jeuxvideo.com,"Dec 31, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
60,"At just two - three hours in length, A Juggler’s Tale is a lean experience with little fat on the bones (though may still be a tad on the short side for some). Nevertheless, it’s a shame that the developer leant on the same type of puzzle for much of the game, as it makes certain areas feel repetitive as a result. If you’re a fan of games like Limbo and Inside, this is a nice alternative; just don’t go expecting a game of the same calibre or quality.",Nintendo Life,"Oct 10, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
40,"A Juggler’s Tale tried to do a lot for a two-hour game, and while that’s not always a bad thing, I wish it had instead just focused on one thing and perfected it rather than throwing so much at me and having none of it land. I also came across a glitch where one of the cutscenes kept causing everything on my screen to freeze. I was eventually able to move past it but this particular issue, coupled with the terrible lighting and clunky controls, made playing through this game feel like a chore.",Gamer Escape,"Oct  6, 2021",A Juggler's Tale,Switch
80,"Although it seems clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, A Knight’s Quest forms its own footprint. Despite a few minor setbacks, A Knight’s Quest does a great job delivering a fun, light-hearted adventure. Its funny storytelling sets it apart and makes a welcome addition to the Switch library. Genre fans should certainly check this one out.",Pure Nintendo,"Oct 18, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
75,"There is an incredible amount of charm and character to A Knight’s Quest. I’d strongly encourage anyone who thinks they can get past the technical and combat issues to give A Knight’s Quest a try. While those issues are substantial and may turn some off, there is an amazing game resting just below the surface.",NintendoWorldReport,"Oct 10, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
66,"A Knight's Quest is very far from the games it takes inspiration from, lacks of personality and presents some combat system issues and bugs. Give it a try only if you are an hardcore fan of The Legend of Zelda series.",SpazioGames,"Oct 10, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
63,"A Knight´s Quest is a good game to younger players. The title presents a simple history with simple challenges. The graphical side is a little bit poor, but it can be a good choice if you want a classic adventure at a good price for a younger player.",Hobby Consolas,"Oct 10, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
60,"It can be difficult for small studios to get a good start in the video game business. At Knight's Quest proves it once again. It's not a bitter failure, as there are things to keep, but it's not enough to simply copy the great names of this industry to make a good title. The lack of originality and the chaotic technique got the better of the game for our part. On the other hand, if you are not afraid to play a RPG you have already seen 25 times, the story length and the price might seduce you.",MGG,"Oct 16, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
60,"A Knight’s Quest brings a much needed light-hearted take on the action-adventure fantasy genre, with a genuinely funny sense of humour running throughout and plenty of world to explore. It’s marred by a poor navigation system, inconsistent visual quality and an overall lack of polish. There’s plenty of fun to be had on this quest, but there’s very little to write home about when the Switch is full to the brim with similar titles that provide superior experiences.",Nintendo Life,"Oct 10, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
50,"A Knight’s Quest seeks to give players access to the serene joy of a 90s action-adventure game. Unfortunately, the result is an unremarkable attempt to go beyond imitation without anything interesting enough to prop it up.",Switch Player,"Nov  4, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
42,"The dialogue is enjoyably sarcastic, and it blends in political commentary in an impressively unobtrusive way, getting the point across without feeling like it has to slam you over the head with it. It’s still not funny enough to make it worth your while to play A Knight’s Quest, though. There are numerous games that do the same thing but in a much better, more interesting way, and you’d be better off playing any — or all — of them than wasting your time and money here.",Gaming Age,"Oct 23, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch
20,"That A Knight's Quest is being sold on the eShop at all is ludicrous. Combat, enemy design, the camera, the save system, and the script were all in desperate need of more time. Sky9 releasing the title as is, is simply downright embarrassing. Beyond the lack of polish and the frequent bugs, this is a title that ignores 20 years of conventional game design philosophy, and massacres itself in the process. Few have managed to mangle the basics of 3D combat so badly. Play anything else. A Knight's Quest is one of the worst games of 2019.",Cubed3,"Oct 21, 2019",A Knight's Quest,Switch

95,"A Little Golf Journey is the best experience I've ever had in a golf game. With a surprisingly deep story, an innovative and inclusive gameplay, and 400 stars and 68 secret items to collect, whether you are looking for a relaxing moment or in search for the perfect conclusion, this game is for you.",Universo Nintendo,"Feb 14, 2022",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
90,"The most surprising part of the experience was becoming engrossed in a story that built without being noticed. The game opens with a letter that originally seems to just be a stand-in for the developer to welcome players to golf, but over time it transitions into something more personal and reflective. What was once a series of formal letters becomes something beautiful, a sincere back and forth between X and Y, the player and the writer. A Little Golf Journey is a game full of surprises and a gameplay loop that never gets old, and comes highly recommended.",Screen Rant,"Oct 18, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
90,"With 400 stars to earn, dozens of Blue Things to find, and countless secrets to discover, it turns out that A Little Golf Journey is actually much larger and content-full than its name would imply. I love having it to chill out with before bedtime as I need to wind down after multi-hour Metroid Dread sessions, and I think it might actually be my new favorite golf game on Switch, closely edging out Golf Story. I did encounter a few technical issues where my ball got stuck and I had to restart the hole, but this wasn’t a frequent occurrence. If you’re looking for a peaceful and zen-inducing golf experience, there might not be any better than A Little Golf Journey. I intend to relive this journey over and over as I shoot for the stars, and yeah, those little blue things, too.",NintendoWorldReport,"Oct 14, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
80,"Step aside multiplayer sports games! With an abundance of multiplayer games clogging up the virtual pipes these days, A Little Golf Journey is an introvert’s breath of fresh, solo-play, air. An arcade puzzle game with golf as the centerpiece. Take a nice, deep breath, but try not to inhale the golf ball.",Switch Player,"Oct 29, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
80,"Don’t write A Little Golf Journey off if you’re not a golfer. This gorgeous little game is more about solving puzzles than the sport, and it blends the two perfectly. Presented in a wonderful level-based package, finding the best way to putt the ball in each level provides a simple but effective gameplay loop that will keep you coming back for more. This is a game that’ll test your thinking skills, but you’ll also have a lot of fun at the same time.",GameSpew,"Oct 19, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
80,"A chilled and deeply satisfying golf game, A Little Golf Journey combines small scale courses with a pleasant soundtrack, a varied art style and a real sense of adventure in a really pleasing way. Even if you don’t like golf as a sport, the environmental puzzles and quirky narrative in this game make for a gratifying experience, even with an occasionally unwieldy camera.",Finger Guns,"Oct 18, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
75,"A relaxing adventure golf game with a lot of content, but a lack of variety.",SECTOR.sk,"Jan 24, 2022",A Little Golf Journey,Switch

60,"A Little Golf Journey oversells its “stunning” courses and struggles to stay fresh with a mostly safe approach, regardless of plot attempts. It’s the sort of game that did enough to make me want to keep going for a few hours, but not enough to finish, let alone 100% it. Lacking diversity, both aesthetically and gameplay-wise, it pales when compared to many other Switch golf titles. But, even with a subpar camera, the secrets are quite a bit of fun. Assuredly not $19.99 fun, though. The content is there, but the enjoyment and polish aren’t as much. Wishlist this one for a sale while you browse other relaxing games on the eShop, and wait for an improved follow-up.",Pure Nintendo,"Oct 26, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch
60,"Replaying the levels only serves to exacerbate a nagging feeling that A Little Golf Journey is simply too repetitive. When you move from one set of levels to the next, the visual design changes, with some courses looking genuinely beautiful. This doesn’t change the fact, however, that the terrain simply lacks variety throughout. The game clearly strives to provide a relaxing experience, but in doing so, it struggles to give much incentive to keep playing.",Nintendo Life,"Oct 20, 2021",A Little Golf Journey,Switch

80,"If you enjoy relaxing puzzle games, A Little to the Left is definitely worth checking out. I hope some of the control issues can be addressed in future updates.",TouchArcade,"Nov 23, 2022",A Little To The Left,Switch
80,"When it all clicks, A Little to the Left provides an experience that is a weird mingling of the semi-passive and viscerally intrusive. It is only the occasions when tiny touch targets cry out for a mouse pointer that the magic falls away. Once that happens, the plainer, less surprising puzzles aren’t able to carry the show on their own. As a piece, it can’t always sustain its best rhythm, but when it does, it's stimulating, quiet, and memorable.",Nintendo Life,"Nov 15, 2022",A Little To The Left,Switch
70,"Overall I found A Little to the Left to be enjoyable in the moment, but after playing I rarely have thought about the game since. The puzzles are very clever and the way they are seemingly integrated into real life objects and locations makes A Little to the Left stand out from many other puzzle games. It should be very accessible to people who do not play a lot of games, even though I felt that by the end that the game had run out of steam and felt a bit too abstract for its own good. While the Switch version performs fine enough, the controls did feel like a drag when using a gamepad, which caused me to play the game in handheld mode with touch screen controls. A Little to the Left has a clear and unique identity among other puzzle games and while it won’t last you an entire weekend there is enough here for those looking for a new type of puzzling challenge.",NintendoWorldReport,"Jan  3, 2023",A Little To The Left,Switch
70,"A Little to the Left is a cute puzzle game in which you organize everyday household items. There’s even a cat who shows up every once in a while, which is always nice (even if he’s always making a bigger mess for you to clean). With a very cozy and relaxing vibe, this game is perfect for those who like to wind down and play something easy, but also a bit challenging.",Pure Nintendo,"Nov 28, 2022",A Little To The Left,Switch
67,"As I said, there’s pleasure to be found in a bit of neatness and order, and A Little to the Left appeals to that specific part of the brain. But it doesn’t do it consistently enough to make the game worth playing, unless you like having a bit of frustration mixed in with your cute and cozy puzzles.",Gaming Age,"Nov 22, 2022",A Little To The Left,Switch

60,"There are many other little things added into A Long Way Down that does help it feel like a much larger game than it actually is. Players can change and level up equipment, craft cards using powder found throughout the world, and some of the overworld levels have very smart puzzles that can be challenging with the limited amount of tile cards. Overall though, A Long Way Down falls short in bringing anything exciting to a genre that is already filled with excellent titles like Slay The Spire or Loop Hero, instead offering a solid back-up experience that supplements those games rather than demands someone's primary attention on its own.",Screen Rant,"Apr  1, 2021",A Long Way Down,Switch

40,"This will probably be held up as anti-intellectual in some way, or part of the crowd who scream every time they see a ""walking simulator"" (a grossly reductive label), but really, this just isn't good art. Of course that's subjective and sure, maybe you'll be profoundly moved in a way that we didn't experience, but we'd wager it's unlikely. It's a game that seems to coast along and then just... fizzle out with no major revelation or real hook. What's a generous word for that? Meditative. It's meditative. Really meditative. Sort of like... sleeping.",Nintendo Life,"Apr  2, 2022",A Memoir Blue,Switch
100,"There’s something really special about a well-crafted puzzle game. The difficulty has to be just right—taking mental equity to solve but not so easy as to be dull. There needs to be a clear logic to the puzzles throughout that acts as a foundation for each sequential one to build off of. What elevates it even further is world building and music design that sews it up into a tight, cohesive experience. A Monster's Expedition’s quick hits of small puzzles passes all of those criteria with flying colors, and you owe it to yourself to give it a look.",NintendoWorldReport,"Aug 31, 2021",A Monster's Expedition,Switch
100,"Overall, A Monster’s Expedition is magnificent. The structure perfectly suits itself to portable play with its interconnected set of islands that you can slowly chip at while on a break or while grabbing a coffee. This release gets everything right and I hope it does well enough to warrant a physical release. If you’ve wanted a relaxing and well-designed puzzle game on Switch, look no further than A Monster’s Expedition which is one of the best games I’ve played this year on the system.",TouchArcade,"Aug 17, 2021",A Monster's Expedition,Switch
90,"A Monster’s Expedition is a brilliant little puzzler. It gets incredible mileage out of a simple mechanic and manages to use it in unexpected ways. The game’s Zen-like presentation, open-ended exploration, and sense of humor create a relaxing environment that soothes away the frustrations found in other puzzle games.

80,"A Musical Story is honestly a fantastic entry in the rhythm game genre. Combining storytelling and rhythm gameplay makes it very original. What's special is that it almost teaches you how to listen to music because of the way that you have to play the game, challenging you without making it impossible, creating a rewarding experience that you can take away from. The songs themselves are so good to listen to and play that you'll probably find yourself wanting to play them again. The story itself certainly makes the game worth playing from start to finish, with great characters and settings. The 70s backdrop gives it that extra edge. The central character Gabriel, while with his own flaws and personal battles, is very endearing. The love interest Amelia also makes a great addition to the cast, her presence and the romance not feeling too forced. All in all, A Musical Story takes you on a special journey, and it would be great to see more games like this.",KeenGamer,"Mar 14, 2022",A Musical Story,Switch
80,"A Musical Story seamlessly combines genres to create an unforgettable experience. Its rhythm segments are a refreshing take on conventions, helping it gain its own identity.

Highlighted through its powerful imagery and stellar soundtrack, this sensitive coming of age story is a sumptuous and sentimental observation of a bygone era.",COGconnected,"Mar  2, 2022",A Musical Story,Switch
70,"In its mission to make you listen to its music, A Musical Story practically hands you a blindfold. The story asks you to relax into its acid-trip jam-session cool, but somewhat harshes the mellow with its insistence on repeating long phrases until they’re perfect. However, it looks and sounds fabulous, and will reward perseverance and repeated plays.",Nintendo Life,"Mar 15, 2022",A Musical Story,Switch
60,"The biggest problem with A Musical Story comes in its gameplay mechanics, though. You play the tunes in sliced out sections, and you have to hit every note perfectly before the game will let you move on. And unless you’re really good with audio cues, you’re going to fail a lot. The worst thing is that once you’ve missed a note, you know you can’t succeed but you still have to finish out the slice anyway. It’s aggravating in the worst way. You never get that feeling of being one with the music that you get with better rhythm games. Great music, an uneven story, and unpleasant gameplay make for a very rocky road trip indeed.",TouchArcade,"Mar  9, 2022",A Musical Story,Switch
70,"A Night At the Races is an interesting if unbalanced narrative experiment.

It’s experimental in a way I’ve rarely seen before, truly offering some clever uses for the Switch platform. Some will decry the game for its encouraged voyeurism, but developer Accidental Queens truly seems to be making an attempt at doing something different while addressing a topic rarely seen in video games, or on Nintendo systems at all, for that matter. Personally, I think that’s admirable, and I certainly hope A Normal Lost Phone encourages similar titles to appear on the eShop in the future.

80,A Normal Lost Phone tells a story of visibility about a group that frequently goes unnoticed in the heteropatriarchal society in which we live.

70,"A Normal Lost Phone does a lot of things right: unlocking story bits is interesting, the phone premise pays off, and the atmosphere sells Sam’s character. Seeing such delicate subject matter in a game is nice, but the end game felt a bit preachy without offering anything too helpful.

40,"A Normal Lost Phone is a tough game to recommend. The concept is intriguing and there’s a genuinely interesting narrative at the center of the experience, but it’s all so fraught by poor execution and mediocre presentation that we can hardly suggest you pick this one up. You could do a whole lot worse for three bucks, but you’re also getting exactly what you pay for and nothing more. If you have some credit leftover in your account from another eShop purchase and feel like distracting yourself with a mildly entertaining adventure game, this one may be worth a look, but you’d best take a pass.",Nintendo Life,"Feb 28, 2018",A Normal Lost Phone,Switch

70,"Despite its faults, I enjoyed my time with A Plague Tale: Innocence. The story is compelling and the characters feel alive. Contrasting with every long load time of the streaming connection was my excitement to find out what the next chapter brought. It's as addicting as it is enthralling. I think that’s what was most disappointing about the streaming software. It kept me from enjoying the game that much sooner.

Amicia's desperate fight is at least as magnificent as the graphics and soundtrack that drive the work.

What it does manage to do is provide endless replay value with its procedural generated platform action, unique items and large variety of enemies. The co-op mode is also a welcomed inclusion. The trade-off here, as mentioned, is no real story or character development beyond the basics to motivate you to save the day and the repetitive nature associated with permadeath.

What we have here is something of an apotheosis – a milestone in indie games akin to Cave Story, or Spelunky. The very best bits of multiple game genres, stripped of all padding and bloat, mixed perfectly into a delicious video game stew that only gets richer and richer the more you play.

But it's the diminutive tales and everyday experiences of A Short Hike that give the game its comforting, even pastoral allure. It's about seeking quiet communion with nature even as you make your umpteenth hike towards the peak, or finding contentment in stumbling upon tinier, quaint scenes. It proposes that even the smallest and most mundane of vignettes can be as enthralling as grandiose universes and narratives of more ambitious games.

The myriad puzzles, while never overtly challenging, switch things up often enough to keep from growing tedious. At the same time, we wholeheartedly recommend it for its bittersweet, sombre narrative alone. It never veers too far into melancholic territory yet handles some heavy topics with grace.

Tourism is the same wonderful blend of genuinely enlightening and deeply rewarding simulation gameplay that will both make you realise the value of mass transit, and help you to understand just how hard it is to get all of it right. Even the cute anime aesthetic, which initially seems so out of place for something so complex, eventually makes sense, too. The Japanese have an understanding of the value of mass transport to a degree that perhaps eclipses any other nation.

From a gameplay point of view it’s not of the highest quality, but it isn’t bad either. In terms of content, design, and mechanics, it is extremely unusual for a game of its vintage.

Sure Absolute Drift: Zen Edition is a driving game, but it’s the golf of driving games; if you’re more of a batting cages kinda player like I am, this one might be more of a swing and a miss, no matter how pretty it is (and it is pretty).

As such, it does not disappoint in the slightest as it remains still a thoroughly playable and enjoyable experience that was in its time amongst the finest golf games available, but also one of the more accessible. Naturally, being a Neo Geo title at heart, Neo Turf Masters is still a very challenging one, and newcomers to the genre of video game golfing should not pick this one as their starting point, since it does not at all explain all the parameters that they should look out for before they hit the ball.

Even those who already own a physical copy should not find it difficult to consider rebuying. Indeed, if anyone can afford a physical copy of this, then the small price of this digital rerelease, which comes complete with online leader boards for them to show off their skills for the world to see, should not prove too hard to swallow.

Playthroughs can be tedious as a result and the biggest challenge becomes trying not to quit the game early.

The big, bold sprites still look great but the animation is poor, and the fact that you can only play as three characters drastically curtails the game's long-term appeal. SNK would refine the series as the years went on, culminating in Garou: Mark of the Wolves, perhaps one of the finest one-on-one fighting games in existence.

80,"Fatal Fury 2 looks and sounds great, has a good fighting system, is very enjoyable but you should absolutely not bother buying it. Why? Because Fatal Fury Special takes all that's good about it and adds in even more content. With flowing combos and a much larger fighting roster (for the same price), this is the version of the game to go for. The main arcade mode can be brutal, but there's lots of top-notch fighting action and two-player fights provide a lot of fun.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 24, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Fatal Fury Special,Switch
40,"Galaxy Fight looks fine and is enjoyable for a short period, but the dull cast, limited fighting mechanics and lack of genuine surprises make it a hard game to recommend, even to seasoned fighting fans. Sunsoft would do much better with Waku Waku 7, so if you like the look of Galaxy Fight you'd perhaps be better off picking that instead. If not, then there are already many other better one-on-one fighters available on the Switch, so there's no real need to check this out - unless of course you're a massive Neo Geo fan and simply have to own all of the range.",Nintendo Life,"Jun 29, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Galaxy Fight - Universal Warriors,Switch
60,Ghost Pilots is recommended only to the die-hard digital Neo Geo collector who has exhausted all other shmup avenues already available on the Switch. More sensible players should look at Video System and Psikyo’s better offerings instead.,Nintendo Life,"Apr 30, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Ghost Pilots,Switch

50,"ACA NEOGEO Gururin is a tough recommendation, even for hardened veterans of falling block puzzlers. The learning curve is enormous, which usually isn't a complaint in itself, but it just doesn't mesh with the pick up and play nature of arcade titles. A lot of time is going to be spent fumbling around and not achieving much of anything. Given enough practice, and a propensity for thinking several moves ahead, players might be able to make some progress. Until then, don't expect to have a lot of fun.",Cubed3,"Apr 23, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Gururin,Switch
50,"Gururin is proof that sometimes the best puzzle concepts are sometimes met with a harsh dose of ‘average’. Despite doing nothing technically wrong, it sadly falls short of other offerings on Neo Geo like the previously released Magical Drop series or the still stubbornly Switch absent Puzzle Bobble series. As such it is only truly recommended to the puzzle fan with nothing else to currently play or the rabid digital Neo Geo collector. Everyone else should just let this one drop.",Nintendo Life,"Apr 18, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Gururin,Switch
50,"Karnov's Revenge can provide some entertainment, but attacks don't flow together with ease, sometimes making button mashing more effective (and quicker) than a well-timed series of planned moves. The weak point system can add a bit of strategy as you target certain spots on an opponent, but with some characters more susceptible to attacks than others it's not a system that works that well or is particularly balanced. Ultimately, more accomplished fighters are available on the Neo Geo (any entry from Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown or King of Fighters series will do), and a number of these can be downloaded on Switch. Pick one of those over this rather limp and uninspired title.",Nintendo Life,"Nov 24, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Karnov's Revenge,Switch
50,"King Of The Monsters is simple to play, but with a range of moves available as you fight your way through the different creatures. Outside of aesthetics the monsters largely play the same however, making the fights quite repetitive. The game works well with the five minute caravan mode as you attempt to smash up as much of the city as possible, whilst not loosing the fight to increase your score. There's no long term appeal with the game, but turn off continues and boot it up for a few two-player fights every now and then and it can still provide some entertainment.",Nintendo Life,"Jan  8, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: King of the Monsters,Switch
80,"Last Resort may be a little rough around the edges in places - the broken two-player mode being the most obvious example - but it's still one of the best shooters on the Neo Geo and a solid purchase for Switch-owning blaster fans. The impeccable presentation really makes the game stand out from the hordes of similar titles, and it's challenging enough to ensure that you won't have it licked in the space of an evening. Casual players may find it a little too stern a test - especially with the checkpoint system which forces you to re-play sections of the game upon death - but serious shooter addicts will be totally at home.",Nintendo Life,"Jun 22, 2017",ACA NEOGEO: Last Resort,Switch

80,"Magical Drop II is a fantastic, fast-paced puzzle game that feels right at home on the Switch, and an easy recommendation for any puzzle game fan. Its unique combo system emphasizes speed and reflexes as much as pre-planning, meaning even those among us who struggle to think through a three-chain in Puyo Puyo can experience the thrill of combo-building in Magical Drop — as long as your thumbs can keep up. The inclusion of the original Japanese version — with its extra mode and voice acting — is icing on the cake; this is a must-play puzzle package.",Nintendo Life,"Jun 30, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Magical Drop II,Switch
90,"Simple to play, Magical Drop III is hugely entertaining as you frantically move about firing balloons to make lines or ideally set in motion a combo. Magical Journey would be better if you could compete against human opposition, but it's still fun (particularly in its Japanese incarnation) and adds additional replay value to a game that already gives you ample reason to return many times over. Magical Drop III is an excellent choice for Switch-owning puzzle fans.",Nintendo Life,"Mar 12, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Magical Drop III,Switch
85,"Although Magical Drop III isn’t at the top of the Switch’s tier list of puzzle games - Puyo Puyo Tetris and Ironcast are fighting for that spot - it’s still a high-tier product. Even if you’ll want to punch that stupid raven after losing for the 35th time, you’ll want to try again. The Neo Geo wasn’t really known for puzzle games, but this is the best that system had to offer.",NintendoWorldReport,"Mar 12, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Magical Drop III,Switch
70,Magical Drop III is definitely one of those puzzle games that you'll be happy to add to your collection and play it every now and again but don't expect it to keep you entertained for longer than an hour at a time.,Video Chums,"Mar  1, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Magical Drop III,Switch
60,"Those with fond memories of gawping at the amazing visuals back in the '90s will no doubt fall in love with Magician Lord's charms all over again and there are some neat ideas on show - such as the ability to morph into different characters - but it sadly hasn't aged as well as its contemporaries. There are plenty of retro games that are extremely difficult, but Alpha Denshi's game combines this with confusing level design to make for a doubly frustrating experience. Perseverance will eventually bring you round to its charms but most people will give up long before it gets to that point, meaning the main trick this magician pulls is making your patience disappear.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 24, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Magician Lord,Switch
80,"You might assume that Metal Slug's numerous sequels would be far superior to the original but that isn't the case; while the other outings in this series add their fair share of neat features, the 1996 original has a simple purity to it which makes it feel more focused and less preoccupied with pushing the hardware (and the imagination of the developers) to the limit. It's arguably one of the finest 2D titles ever made, and while the gameplay might be seem rather shallow to modern players, if you're a fan of old-school arcade blasters which task you with scoring as many points as possible, then this is a must-have.",Nintendo Life,"Apr 19, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Metal Slug,Switch
80,"Metal Slug's speed, challenge, and overall fun, as well as the marvellously crafted cartoony visuals that come along with it, have not lost their charm after all these years.

60,"Offering the usual fun and gun action as the rest of the series, Metal Slug 2 will provide a lot of entertainment and the High Score and Caravan modes add to the replayability of it. The downside is that this is an authentic recreation of the original game, warts and all. The well designed stages, amusing character designs, detailed scenery and brilliant soundtrack are great, but the slowdown is painful at times. Smaller dips in performance are easy to put up with, but the larger ones harm the game, and your enjoyment. There's still fun to be had here, but Metal Slug 2 is far from an essential download, and it might be a better idea to wait for Metal Slug X, which fixes the slowdown and adds more content.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 22, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Metal Slug 2,Switch
80,"Whether someone is familiar with Metal Slug 3 or not, this conversion under the banner of the ACA Neo Geo series, will work wonders.

Veterans and newcomers alike will all find plenty of reasons to invest their time and effort here.",FNintendo,"Apr 22, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Metal Slug 3,Switch
80,"The game’s difficulty level also strays on the balanced side for most Neo Geo titles. It’s definitely hard, but with enough dexterity all enemy and boss attack patterns can be avoided in some way. Its gameplay is easy to understand, and it’s a lot more fun when shared. An average run from beginning to end will put you at roughly two hours, but the game’s branching paths and overall energetic pace mean that this is a title you’ll want to come back to over and over again.",Digitally Downloaded,"Apr  6, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Metal Slug 3,Switch
80,"Without a doubt this is one of the most enjoyable arcade experiences on Nintendo Switch right now. Sure, it may be a classic and shunned by some purely on that basis, but the core gameplay of ACA NeoGeo: Metal Slug 3 has held strong over time, and proves to be just as addictive and challenging as it ever was...plus, it still looks mighty fine indeed. With the added benefit of other versions of the game included right from the off, a selection of control options, special extra challenge modes, and online leaderboards, the only thing that could top this is an anthology collection, similar to the one found on Wii years ago.",Cubed3,"Mar 27, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Metal Slug 3,Switch

It doesn't feature the best emulation, and the controller options could be clearer, but deep down it is a very solid game full of delicious, sweet eye candy.

80,"This is an impressive, feature-rich package. The game itself is an enjoyable slice of action, if not quite up to the level of the Metal Slug games that have seen mobile releases so far.

A number of moves (including the sometimes tactical use of specials) keeps the fighting entertaining whether playing alone or with a friend. There are some decent character designs for the mutants and robots, with some nice touches in their animations such as a transformation or the way a seemingly human foe's face is punched off to reveal the robot inside. Once cleared there's not a lot of immediate replay value, but you can always try and improve in the Hi Score and Caravan modes; whenever you do boot it up, Mutation Nation provides a great scrolling beat 'em up fix.",Nintendo Life,"Nov  2, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Mutation Nation,Switch
80,"Another top quality retro game for Switch, NAM-1975 provides top tier multiplayer blasting action, a large range of customisation that the future Virtual Console would do well to copy, and classic pixel art.

60,"NAM-1975's status as a Neo Geo launch title means that while it's fun in short bursts, it's a long way from being the best the console has to offer. The action gets repetitive after long periods of time and in terms of visuals, it's quite a dull game in places. Still, if you're a fan of old-school coin-op blasters like Operation Wolf and Dynamite Duke then this is well worth a look, and the enhancements made by publisher Hamster Corporation are excellent, as always.",Nintendo Life,"Mar 23, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: NAM-1975,Switch
50,"Its status as a hard-to-find title may have amplified its status with collectors, but in reality this is actually a very average racing title which lacks longevity and won't keep you occupied for very long.

There's a range of serve options, power shots and frantic moments where you hope to get to the ball in time, but the simplified nature leads to little variety even with the various shot types. There are times you can score quickly (maybe even from a serve) and there is a rush of excitement when you do so, but there is also a lot of time spent knocking the ball back-and-forth, simply tapping left or right to get into position to make sure the process can continue.

Despite some elements blending into the background on occasion and moments of slowdown, the visuals in the game are well done. The music is great and enhances the experience greatly. A detachable pod would be a good option to add some choice to how you tackle the challenge and too often you must rely on memorisation to get through the dangers, but nevertheless Pulstar remains an tough yet enjoyable retro offering.",Nintendo Life,"Jan  6, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Pulstar,Switch

70,"The 19 (plus four) characters provide a good variety of options for the fighting and the battles are as fun as ever thanks to the usual range of offensive options and evasive manoeuvres. The fun out of bounds victories from the first Real Bout game have gone and there's been a change to the multi-plane system, but there's still plenty of fighting thrills to be had here. Real Bout 2 is ultimately a better game, but Real Bout Fatal Fury Special is still a solid fighter that can provide plenty of entertainment.",Nintendo Life,"May 16, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Real Bout Fatal Fury Special,Switch

A good range of enemies (and a number of ways to defeat those enemies) keeps the action interesting and there are a number of fun boss encounters. There's not a lot of incentive to replay once cleared, but the usual Hi Score and Caravan modes adds some replayability as you look to improve your scores.

With a focus on patience and its use of weapons, the game has a different feel to your typical one-on-one brawler. Later games would include additions to the fighting system but there's something undeniably appealing about the simpler version offered here. That's not to say it's superior (the sequel is definitely a better game), but this first instalment holds up remarkably well despite the passage of time and is well worth buying, even if you already own the later Samurai Shodown IV, which is already available on the Switch eShop at the time of writing.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 25, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Samurai Shodown,Switch

This is still a game that requires thought, but when you do spy your opportunity fights can be over quickly. Even if they're not, they can still be fast-paced as you each use various means to avoid getting hit and the new weapon-breaking moves can help turnaround certain defeat - or lead to you looking a bit foolish if you get defeated by an unarmed opponent. There's plenty of one-on-one fighters on the Switch, but this is one of the best.",Nintendo Life,"Feb  9, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Samurai Shodown II,Switch

The fighting still entertains, but as good as the game is, the already available fourth game more or less does the same, but better. There's definitely fun to be had from the game, but like a number of Neo Geo titles Samurai Shodown III has been bettered by others from its own series.",Nintendo Life,"May 11, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: Samurai Shodown III,Switch
80,"While Samurai Shodown IV wasn't the last game in the series, it is considered by some fans to be the best, and with good reason. The weapon-based gameplay is refined after the experiments of the first three outings and roster of fighters is unique and varied; add in the ""Slash"" and ""Bust"" variants and you've quite a few combat options to master. All of the Samurai Shodown games boast excellent presentation but this entry truly benefits from the increased storage available on the Neo Geo at the time; smooth animation and plenty of detail in the backgrounds helps to elevate the game above many other 2D releases of the period. While it's easy to grumble about the proliferation of fighting games on SNK's platform, this franchise has always set itself apart thanks to its focus on swords and other weapons, so if you're sick of Street Fighter and can't stand another King of Fighters then this might be just the tonic you need.",Nintendo Life,"May 24, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Samurai Shodown IV,Switch

60,"Sengoku would go on to establish a franchise which improved drastically over time, but this debut title is one that should perhaps remain in the past, despite some neat ideas. It's not that you won't gain any enjoyment from it - in fact, with two players, Sengoku is a perfectly pleasant way to spend an evening - it's just that there are so many other superior examples of this kind of game available. Unless you have a strong nostalgic bond with the game from your arcade-going youth or you're a huge fan of side-scrolling brawlers then we'd recommend you save your eShop credit for one of the other ACA Neo Geo titles, or wait for the far superior sequels to arrive.",Nintendo Life,"Jun 21, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Sengoku,Switch

70,"Shock Troopers may not add much to the top-down run-and-gun genre but it's enjoyable while it lasts. The visuals weren't particularly awe-inspiring back in 1997, but everything moves at a slick pace and neat elements of humour prevent things from becoming too serious. In single player you might get a week or so of play out of this, but with two people involved it becomes a lot more appealing - and thanks to those detachable Joy-Cons, co-op sessions are easy to arrange.

70,"Street Hoop is a game that offers a quick basketball fix: you simply choose a country and then play commences. Despite the lack of options and the fact there's only ten countries available, the simple pick-up-and-play approach works well. The game therefore shares similarities with Super Sidekicks, but it works better here thanks to the fast-paced high-scoring nature of the matches. There's lots of enjoyment as the action moves from one side of the court to the other, shooting, dunking, feigning moves and players shoving each other out of the way. Further entertainment is provided by successfully keeping (or winning) the ball to prevent your opponent unleashing a super shot and winning with the last throw of the game is thrilling. Playing through the arcade mode entertains, but the game works best in two-player mode and Street Hoop is a good option when looking for a quick bout of two-player fun.",Nintendo Life,"Nov 15, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Street Hoop,Switch
50,"There are a few changes to the football formula, but SNK's arcade version of the sport can still provide entertainment. Caravan mode gives you a different way to play, though it lacks the replayability offered by a shooter with that mode. The regular arcade mode doesn't give players much of a reason to return once the cup has been won; a lack of options and teams limiting the game's appeal. The quick-play nature brought about by that lack of options works well for two-player matches however, and if you are looking for something simple and fun to play to play with a friend, then Super Sidekicks can provide a quick footie fix.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 30, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Super Sidekicks,Switch

Figuring out your best team and then battling through either the arcade mode or against a friend leads to some very enjoyable times. Subsequent instalments would improve on the formula, however, and that makes this game a less than essential purchase. What storyline is in the game will be of interest to some, but whilst it can certainly entertain The King of Fighters '95 doesn't offer as full an experience as The King of Fighters '98; if you are only looking for one KoF game to stick on your Switch, that is the one to go for.",Nintendo Life,"Oct 15, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: The King of Fighters '95,Switch

Of course, all of this and more would feature in the ultimately better The King of Fighters '98, but it's a confident entry in the series nonetheless.

70,"The King of Fighters '99 doesn't reach the heights of its immediate predecessor, but by changing things up there's still fun to be had from the different way of playing offered by the introduction of Strikers. There's a good variety of characters to play as and the game offers the expected enjoyable multiplayer with friends. However, just as earlier games in the series were ""good, but not as good as the one after"", KOF '99 would be improved upon by its follow-up. Those interested in story will want to see the beginnings of the NESTS storyline, but from a purely gameplay perspective KOF 2000 is a better option.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 15, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: The King of Fighters '99,Switch
70,"Although it’s one of the better installments in the series, The King Of Fighters 2000 isn’t quite the best of the bunch. It isn’t even the best of the ones available on Switch: many would argue that KOF ‘98 presents the game at its purest before the Striker system was introduced and started complicating things. If you’ve yet to buy a King Of Fighters game on your Switch, then, it might be worth trying out the 1998 version first to see if it’s the sort of thing you enjoy. If it is, then by all means get stuck into KOF 2000 to see how it evolved, for better or worse.",Nintendo Life,"Aug 22, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: The King of Fighters 2000,Switch
90,"Easy to pick up and play, The Last Blade may at first seem a simple fighting game but you'll soon discover a good range of fighting options as you employ a mix of defensive and offensive tactics to see you through. Fights among the well-balanced cast of characters are hugely entertaining whether putting together a series of moves, interrupting an attack with a well timed deflection or simply stopping your opponent's assault with a kick to the face. Its excellent sequel will make an appearance on Switch in the future and should you only wish to have one Last Blade game, you'll need to decide if you prefer some extra characters and the EX mode to the balanced fighter lineup in this first game. Ideally, they'd be bundled together, but even on its own The Last Blade is one of the best picks for Switch-owning fighting fans.",Nintendo Life,"Dec 31, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: The Last Blade,Switch

80,"Overall, Waku Waku 7 is an almost perfect port, which more than successfully transmits the spirit of the original arcade hit. While it does lack an extra layer of effort, which would elevate this piece of content amongst some of the best on the eShop today, this is still a captivating and unique experience that is well worth checking out regardless of experience with the genre. Avid fighter fans will find something nostalgic and refreshing about it, even today, and those with no prior experience will still find something unique and memorable at the heart of this retro beat-em-up. This is definitely one of the more exciting offerings from the ACA NeoGeo range.",Cubed3,"Mar 27, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: Waku Waku 7,Switch
80,"Waku Waku 7 is just the tonic for those of you who are disenchanted with the abundance of thematically-similar fighting games on the Neo Geo. While the roster of combatants is admittedly small, this cast is arguably more vibrant and entertaining than any that Street Fighter or King of Fighters can muster, and the gloriously kinetic feel of the action makes it stand apart from other examples of the genre.

50,"There's only eight characters and the simple combat setup means there are not as many moves available as in other one-on-one brawlers. The slow speed of the fights is another negative, but death matches liven things up a bit even if you can lose from poor positioning rather than something your opponent has done. Though not the most fully-featured series, subsequent games would add characters and tweak the gameplay (the regular World Heroes 2 also features death matches, though handled a little differently), and so whilst World Heroes can provide some fun fights, those desperately looking to pit historically-inspired fighters against each other would be better off with one of the sequels.",Nintendo Life,"Dec 10, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes,Switch
60,"Offering a simple three-button setup World Heroes 2 may not offer quite as many offensive options as other fighting games, but there's a good range of fighters and bouts can still entertain. Subsequent games in the series would add to the gameplay, however, with the already available World Heroes Perfect being the top World Heroes option for best of three round fights. What this game does have over the next two instalments is the revamped Death Match mode that provides a fun alternate way of playing as the energy bar moves back and fourth during the battles and you avoid the hazards or try to use them to your advantage. Fights can often go the distance with the marker shifting to the victor in the final moments. World Heroes 2 may not be the best fighting game available on Switch, but it can still entertain.",Nintendo Life,"Feb  5, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes 2,Switch
60,"The increased pace may make the holding for strong attacks less practical than before, but everything flows better and generally makes for more fun in the fights. Further improvements would be made with World Heroes Perfect, however, and (unlike regular WH2) there's no alternative way of play that makes this game at least worth considering. World Heroes 2 Jet is not a bad fighter, but it's not a must-download title either.",Nintendo Life,"Apr  5, 2018",ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes 2 Jet,Switch
70,"World Heroes Perfect stands out from other fighters thanks to its unusual cast and vibrant atmosphere, and is without a doubt the best version in the entire series. The action is fluid and responsive and the simplified super move system makes it easy to understand for newcomers. The only real criticism is that while World Heroes Perfect refines the franchise after some inconsistent early entries, it was never iterated upon and even by 1995 standards it was hardly pushing the envelope of the genre. Fans of the series will no doubt be pleased, but those coming to the series without any prior experience many want to check out titles like King of Fighters '98 and Samurai Shodown IV before investing in this.",Nintendo Life,"May  2, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes Perfect,Switch
70,"World Heroes Perfect is an enjoyable and well executed 2D fighting game of the mid-90s that features impressive visuals and a varied cast with some impressive special moves.

60,"What you won't get is much personality or balance. The game undersells its ""real people from history"" basis; indeed, some of them I didn't even recognise at first. Their fighting styles are only vaguely reminscient of their real-world personalities, too, which is disappointing (aside from the special attacks, that are spot on). More critically, there are some characters with spammy attacks that make the game far too easy, and other characters that are next to useless. Given that the game already has a small roster, this doesn't do much to help its long term value.",Digitally Downloaded,"Apr  6, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes Perfect,Switch
50,"Minus a couple hiccoughs here and there, ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes Perfect is a flawless, and 100% faithful version of the original arcade effort. However, this cannot change the fact that World Heroes Perfect was, and still is, nothing more than a generic fighter that pales in comparison to the strong competition in the genre, and even compared to SNK's more famous The King of Fighters line. In other words: this is nothing more than a collector's item product.",Cubed3,"Mar 27, 2017",ACA NeoGeo: World Heroes Perfect,Switch

Of course, none of that would matter if the game wasn't entertaining, but luckily NMK has crafted a fun shooter. The music seems an unusual choice at first, but proves to be a good fit with the frantic play style required for the game. It's not without fault however, and the action is sometimes easy to lose track of when the screen gets cluttered and there are moments of noticeable slowdown. Your ship is also quite large considering all the activity onscreen, leading to some moments of frustration when you're unsuccessful in navigating high concentrations of bullets.

Not every game mode is a hit - with Shark Fever and Ace Angler Party standing out as duds - but Ace Angler+, Legend of the Poisoned Seas, and the core gameplay loop more than make up for it. There is a massive variety of fish to catch, with several different stages and Rods to unlock as well. The actual fishing mechanics aren't explained too well in-game, but they're intuitive no matter the control scheme. Load times are on the long side and the gacha elements needed for unlockables aren't exactly welcome, but they're not deal-breakers, either.

The coin concept is off-putting enough until someone has a surplus of coins to play with. The story mode does a better job of easing you into the game mechanics because it removes the token mechanic and provides focused goals. The minigames and online play are fun, but they're terrible for the overall goal of the game. The coin-pushing game is a very slow burn unless you get lucky.

Due to the catering of this particular audience, the fact that there are no signs of this arcade cabinet ever coming West in an official manner, and the fact that a good chunk of Ace Angler: Fishing Spirit’s game modes are a matter of luck rather than skill makes this just a very frustrating game overall unless you aren’t bothered by the randomness of it.",Noisy Pixel,"Nov  3, 2022",Ace Angler: Fishing Spirits,Switch

You can tell this was derived from a game that is only one step removed from gambling. It puts on a decent performance of making you think you have a say in the outcome, but you really don’t. Perhaps as a lower-priced affair I could see this working better, but at the price point it’s targeting there just isn’t enough meat on the bones here in any sense.

Had ACORN come out prior to Ubisoft’s release, I think it would have been a nice preview to the tactical RPG genre on Switch, but trying to play it now just reminds me of how good Kingdom Battle was and that you would be better suited to investing your money into a big budget game that will provide better gameplay and much more replayability.",NintendoWorldReport,"Jan  2, 2018",ACORN Tactics,Switch

An option to allow the AI to move faster would have greatly improved the flow of the game. As is, the battles are just too slow.

Some will find the changes intrusive. It would have been nice if there was a classic mode included that strips out the tower defense to make everyone happy, but that’s not in the cards.

Rarely are two totally different gameplay styles fused this effectively, and the enhancements introduced by developer Sonic Powered really do improve things; combat in the action sections is more fun, while the 'God Sim' portions of the game are lent increased depth thanks to thoughtful gameplay upgrades. To cap it all off, Yuzo Koshiro's music – available in both its SNES and rearranged forms – is masterful.

However, the questionable choices in the art direction, the bugs, poor performance and the, at times, way too wordy expanded script, mar the experience in such a way that what should have been the masterful return of a masterpiece instead turns out to be a nice introduction to the classic for new audiences, but not much more. There's no shaking the feeling that this re-release was not treated with all the care that such an important landmark title deserved. The extra content sweetens the deal somewhat, and encourages fans of the original to come back for more, but the price of admission for such an end result is a bit too much perhaps.",Cubed3,"Dec 20, 2021",ActRaiser Renaissance,Switch

The gameplay loop of varying between action platformer and city-building sim did get its hooks in me but will be a harder sell for others. While it proves difficult to remain a strong recommendation, there are nuggets of character dialogue gold in there that are worth seeing through. On top of that, the visuals and music that come with these moments are special and remain evident why this is such a cult classic.

The most interesting quality is that there is a two-player co-op mode, which changes the dynamic of the game drastically. The real shining moments are during the defending the target portions of the levels, since teamwork actually matters and doing these alone can be a bit much to manage.

Developer Forgotten Key has crafted an enchanting world here, with a fantastically fun and fitting means of traversing it; a splintered land full of melancholy memories in which you soar, a singular source of hope in flight above a world that’s relying on you for salvation.

The camera is too zoomed-out for handheld mode, and the framerate is very choppy compared to the other smooth versions.

75,"Agatha Knife is insanely intelligent and strives through its unique narrative. The art direction and music compliment the theme, making it a solid package overall.

70,"Agatha Knife tackles vast subjects with surreal humour and delightful style but when it comes to the big questions, it doesn’t offer much beyond sarcasm and a shrug.

70,"Ageless isn’t timeless, but it is fun for a while. The experience would be a much smoother and more memorable one if its primary mechanic was easier to execute. Each world culminates in a boss fight, and these border on maddening when coupled with scarce checkpoints, the aforementioned aiming issues, and a system of progression that’s essential trial-and-error. Those who like their platformers extra spicy may find a satisfying 10 hours here, but be warned that fighting with the controls is par for this course.",NintendoWorldReport,"Aug  4, 2020",Ageless,Switch

70,"Ageless is the sort of game that could best be described as a great concept that almost nails the execution. The sombre narrative, cerebral gameplay, and distinct presentation are all great in their own regard, but each is plagued with enough inconsistencies and caveats to hold back the overall experience from true greatness. We’d give this one a cautious recommendation, as the distinct brand of puzzle-platforming gameplay ultimately proves to be a worthwhile experience, but this is also certainly not the ‘next Celeste’. Still, if you’ve been looking for a decent new indie for your Switch that you can clear in a reasonably short timeframe, it’s tough to go wrong here.",Nintendo Life,"Jul 28, 2020",Ageless,Switch
60,"There's no doubt that Ageless is based on a laudable concept and that
its plot, as well as its blend between platforming and puzzle elements
work at a competent degree. As far as the audiovisual experience goes,
however, Ageless needs more work. Overall and all things considered,
this game means well, tries to get there and is worthy of some attention
on behalf of Nintendo Switch players.",Starbit,"Aug 21, 2020",Ageless,Switch
60,"Ageless lands in an odd spot. It’s not bad - compelling level design and interesting puzzles keep your attention through its 8-odd hour runtime.

It’s a great game to share with others, but it’s fun to play on your own, too. Even at twice the cost of the mobile version, the game is well-worth the price on the Switch.

85,"Overall, Agent A: A Puzzle In Disguise is a clever and straightforward adventure-puzzle game. It’s much more accessible and condensed than something like Myst or The Witness, but it’s easy to complete over the course of a few evenings. Unfortunately, the Switch port seems to have done away with the challenges and achievements of the mobile versions, so there isn’t really any reason to replay Agent A after completing it.

Good luck, Agent!",NintendoWorldReport,"Oct  7, 2019",Agent A: A Puzzle In Disguise,Switch
80,"Agent A is cute, clever and an absolute joy of a world to play around in. It’s the sort of game where you can, like I did, invite someone to sit on the couch with you and help out with some puzzle solving, or just keep it on hand to occasionally pick up and play through a chapter. It’s absolutely worth your time and money, but if you’re grabbing it for the Switch just be prepared for a more handheld experience.",Vooks,"Aug 29, 2019",Agent A: A Puzzle In Disguise,Switch

70,"The gameplay is similar to other hidden object games, but the stylized look and groovy vibe give it a definite leg up. You’ll do a lot of tapping on things, object manipulation puzzles, and searching each room for hidden codes, safes and other secret things across a variety of locations and missions.

70,"Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise is a fun little puzzler. It has fairly simple puzzles, but the real challenge is connecting the dots and figuring out what you need to use and where. I may be stuck in chapter 5, yet I can still happily recommend it. The visuals may be a little underwhelming, but it’s more than serviceable for the type of game this is. I would heavily recommend that you play it in handheld mode, too, though using a controller is not inhibiting.

Aggelos feels ageless, which is a truly lovely thing to experience.",Nintendo Insider,"May 10, 2019",Aggelos,Switch
80,"Aggelos it's a time travel, an adventure in the vein of those that we enjoyed in the 16-bit era, An oversaturated genre even in Switch (pixel art, platforming and 2D metroidvania action) with a style of gameplay adapted to modern tastes. It's not an innovative title, but it's fun, pretty and its right pace helps to get hooked till the end.",Hobby Consolas,"Sep 23, 2019",Aggelos,Switch
80,"Overall, this is a great little retro adventure that doesn’t outstay its welcome. It plays like a top tier title from back in the day, presents you with the sort of gameplay you want and expect from this type of game and serves it all up at a pace with such consistent quality that it’s hard not to be won over, no matter how fatigued you may be by the idea of another blast of old school pixel action.",Nintendo Life,"May  7, 2019",Aggelos,Switch

It’s not often you see a game that fails in almost literally every aspect imaginable, but that’s exactly what you get here.",Gaming Age,"Nov  7, 2019",Agony,Switch
75,"Speaking of grind, in a sense ‘grind’ is the basis of gameplay for not only Aground but also the genre as a whole – grind resources to hit the next objective, rinse and repeat. However, in Aground players may be more acutely aware of this as the progression is largely linear, although players can explore at their own pace and the world is semi-randomized. This is not a detriment per se – in fact, it seems clear that the game is built with this as the goal in mind, and thus those who enjoy the grind will find themselves at home.",GameCritics,"Mar  1, 2021",Aground,Switch
75,"Aground surprised me with how much I kept wanting to get back to it the more I played. It won’t win any awards for its visuals and could certainly do well by limiting battling. That said, it hit the mark with tranquil digging, incentivizing crafting with small goals in its missions, and gradually pushing you along to explore the wider world around your starting grounds. If you like your crafting but want a guiding hand for your experience, Aground is a good place to start.",NintendoWorldReport,"Feb 12, 2021",Aground,Switch

It uses a dual narrative thread to create two worlds that are six years apart, yet closely connected, and gives the players enough surprises with a super plot twist at the end. The renovation of the investigation mechanism and the increase in pseudoscience content make this game seem more ""detective style"". Excellent characterizations, as well as a large number of interesting memes, all give the players a different type of emotional experience. The addition of more mini-games also brings a lot of different kinds of fun to the game. Unfortunately, the connection between the two protagonists in this game is too weak. In addition, the new protagonist Ryuki seems to be difficult to attract the attention of the players.

The challenges the game offers also give you a variety of goals to work towards and various helpful rewards to unlock which not only helps encourage replayability but offers short term goals that can keep you playing for hours.

While I did enjoy it more on PC, the PSP roots are still there and it just feels like more should’ve been done to bring the original Akiba’s Trip to a modern audience.

It’s an interesting satire of the otaku lifestyle, both poking fun at and embracing it...Most of the time, though, it’s like playing a stripped-down version of Yakuza. You wander a Japanese neighborhood, shop, do side-quests, build up your character, much like in that venerated series. But then the combat sucks and the story is poorly paced. On the other hand, I can’t deny it grew on me. It feels like one of those janky, Japanese, early PS2 titles like Mr. Mosquito or Robot Alchemic Drive.

I know that there’s an implied sexiness to the game (yes I got the title pun) but still. Akiba’s Trip was a series I’ve always been curious about. I understand the fan service of finding quirky excuses to strip your enemies but everything around this just feels outdated. The mechanics have not aged well, the story rarely gets passed ‘eye rolling,’ and combat is frustratingly repetitive. From my understanding, there are many quality of life improvements that have occurred in later entries into the series but this remastered version keeps it faithful to the original, warts and all.

I get that in the absence of Undead & Undressed on the Switch, Akiba’s Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed might seem tempting if you’re after this sort of thing. It shouldn’t be, though.

I was intrigued by the idea of bringing back an overlooked entry in the PSP’s library to modern systems and a new fanbase, but I’d go as far as to say that you’re better off just playing the original or Akiba’s Trip: Undead & Undressed. Akiba’s Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed might be worth sticking through for the experience of feeling like you’re wandering through Akihabara, but the clunky combat, thin plot, and poor performance make this a stripped-down experience.

It may struggle to appeal in the long-term in the same way as Tempest or his recent Polybius, owing to its slightly less absorbing construction; and those uninitiated in Minter’s unusual thought processes may find it altogether abstruse.

When compared to the original Alan Wake, though, the Switch port is absolutely comparable. There’s similar gameplay and visual treatment that we’d seen back in 2010, which isn’t a bad thing, though you may not want to revisit it too often.

The game plays exactly as you remember with consistent frame rates throughout and intuitive controls, but if you've played Alan Wake Remastered on a different platform, then you need only apply if you're a hardcore fan of Remedy's creation.

Jankenteam has successfully rejuvenated the legendary hero, hopefully kickstarting a resurgence of the series.",COGconnected,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
75,"If you're a fan of the original Alex Kidd in Miracle World, then this remake gives you just about everything you could want, and more, and you can add a good point or so to my score. If some of the rougher aspects of the original turned you away, the new unlimited lives option might be enough to compensate . . . or it might not. And if you've never played Alex Kidd before, then you might consider looking at the cheaper SEGA AGES version and decide from there if you want a bigger and better version of that.

75,Affectionate remake of a classic jump & run. It has a few problems though and despite a “classic” mode the original is nowhere to be seen.,4Players.de,"Jul 14, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
75,Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is a great remake and a good 2D platform title that provides a lot of fun. A visually and soundly renewed classic game that will delight both veteran and new players.,Nintenderos,"Jun 27, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"Despite the gameplay showing its age, it is what it is and I was enamored with it. It’s a wonderful refresh for a classic title like this, and hopefully, we’ll see a similar return of other mascot platformers from bygone eras in the same style.",GameCritics,"Aug 13, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"A good remake of a legendary Sega videogame, the return of a legend from the days of the Master System. Despite an uninspiring longevity, it turns to be fun and overwhelming.",Eurogamer Italy,"Jul 29, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"In an age where there’s an abundance of polished 2D indie platformers, Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX may not reach the same impact that the original once did. Nonetheless, this game is an adoring love letter by a team who undoubtedly shared a similar nostalgic childhood memory that I will always personally share and cherish. While a fancy lick of paint and some quality of life features will unlikely ever quite capture the magic that once made the original experience so special, Jankenteam has done its absolute best to beautifully repaint a classic that deserves to be remembered and retold.",Nintendo Insider,"Jul 21, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"Now, the argument over game length is one that's endlessly debated, and I'm firmly in the camp that says that fun is fun, and I certainly had fun revisiting the world of my onigiri-chomping namesake for a brief while. I could certainly see plenty of others finding it less compelling, however, because beyond the visuals, so very little has changed in 35 years. Yikes. 35 years. Presumably, Prince Alex is now King Alex of Radaxian by now. I'd better get back to my throne. Dammit, did I just say that out loud?",Digitally Downloaded,"Jun 23, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is a love letter to an early Sega mascot, an unforgiving but very colourful platformer that will please old time fans of the genre.",SpazioGames,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"A solid reworking of a brutal but characterful retro platform game, which offers a fascinating insight into the earliest days of the genre.",Metro GameCentral,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
70,"It's not perfect, as players may find the controls a little loose and the lack of change and additional features may make some question its worth, but it's nonetheless a good recreation of the fantastic Master System title.",Screen Rant,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
65,"Alex Kidd makes a return with mixed results. The aesthetic of Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is very eye-catching and can make it fun to watch being played by speedrunners or those familiar with the series. For those looking to have a more classic experience, the swappable color palette available in the main mode and the unlockable port are worth a look. The release is rounded out with a boss rush mode to serve up a challenging 2D platformer that’s worth a try before the game shows itself as a product of its time.",NintendoWorldReport,"Sep  1, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
65,"Alex Kidd in Monster World DX is a faithful remake of the original, but the difficulty of a bygone era rears its ugly head far too often.",God is a Geek,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX converts an old classic into a new era and
goes beyond the original formula, bringing new levels and game modes.
The result is a fun game, with a great performance, and a good chance of
appealing to both newcomers and veterans alike. While some of the game's
original flaws remain unaddressed and the classic mode might not please
everyone equally, this modern take on the original Alex Kidd game is a
welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch catalogue.",Starbit,"Jul 18, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"In an audio and visual sense, this DX remaster is absolutely amazing. But when it comes
to gameplay and core design, it is exactly the same as the original. In other words,
Alex Kidd has aged poorly and when it comes to reintroducing it to the modern age, it
requires much more than a facelift. Fans of the original may enjoy it being true to the
first game, but in truth, it simply should have been improved much more when it
comes to its ancient mechanics and gameplay design.",PLAY! Zine,"Jul 10, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"The remake excels at presenting the experience with a captivating art style and good soundtracks. However, it fails to learn from the platformers of today and sticks with the outdated design of the original game.",TrueGaming,"Jun 29, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"The more I played Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX, the more I questioned who it’s supposed to be for. It leaves too much of the of-its-time original game intact to be a good choice for new players. It changes too many things that probably should have been left alone to work as a hit of nostalgia. With SEGA’s own fantastic SEGA AGES release of Miracle World available on the Switch for a fraction of the price, this game should have been free to take bigger chances on modernizing the gameplay as much as it updates the presentation. In the end, it’s a weird mid-point that may appeal to some (but not all) hungry Alex Kidd fans and very few others.",TouchArcade,"Jun 29, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"Both true to its original foundation and distant in its changes, Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is arguably not the remake fans of the character could hope for. Some will think the progression is out of date, and they won't be wrong, but the biggest problem is imprecise controls and collisions with enemies. With its very colorful production and quality musical themes, the experience remains correct, but less striking than expected.",Jeuxvideo.com,"Jun 27, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX from Merge Games and Jankenteam is a very niche product with very niche marketability. I imagine the game will be received well in territories where the Sega Master System held on to a longer life-span, such as Brazil and Europe. For the rest of the world though, there just isn’t enough here to bring Alex Kidd into the modern age.",Shacknews,"Jun 25, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
60,"Unfortunately, once the story mode has been completed, there is very little replay value, outside of unlocking a boss rush and 'classic mode'. There is definitely a hardcore challenge there for those who play without the helping hand of infinite lives, but those who don't should be able to get through the story mode in under an hour or so. Certainly, a great trip down memory lane for those old enough to remember the original, but newer players may find it somewhat frustratingly difficult and lacking compared to more modern 2D platformers.",Cubed3,"Jun 24, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
55,"While the remake part is great, with fantastic visuals and awesome music, the rest of Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX didn't age well, with cumbersome gameplay mechanics, some questionable level designs and annoying bosses.",Vgames,"Jun 23, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
55,Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is a wonderful-looking game held back by its developers clinging to the gameplay of the original Master System title. Some quality-of-life improvements could have saved it from mediocrity.,Nintendo Enthusiast,"Jun 23, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
50,"Alex Kidd was more or less usurped by Sonic the Hedgehog as SEGA’s golden boy, and it’s not hard to see why. This platformer may have rendered some fun in 1986, but considering it’s a direct remake, it’s still a clunky platformer that has not aged well. If you’re an Alex Kidd fan, this is nothing short of a must-have, the QoL improvements make it a little more playable, and it’s one of the best-looking remakes on the Switch. If you need a satisfying platforming fix, it’s hard to recommend this classic title.",Pure Nintendo,"Jun 30, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
50,"Sadly, Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is too faithful to the original game, which didn't aged as well as a Wonder Boy Dragon's Trap, to mention another SEGA game remade. Sure, Jankenteam made a beautiful job and it's a pleasure to watch and listen. But it's also a quite irritating 2D platformer as it doesn't play very well and lacks precise controls and hitboxes.",Gameblog.fr,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
50,"We can't pretend this isn't a disappointment. After promises of updates and improvements to this classic title, what we've got is something that we'd honestly not recommend to either prospective new fans or enthusiasts of the original Alex Kidd. We're inclined to think this may have been something of a rushed release, but that's pure speculation based on some of the more lax features (there's a lot of new dialogue but almost all of it is awkwardly written, with typos and errors). Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX is not horrible by any means, and you might have fun with it until you run up against its irritating issues — unless you use infinite lives, in which case you'll finish the game in two hours, tops. If this was supposed to be Alex Kidd's big comeback, we're sad to say that we don't think we'll be seeing that Alex Kidd: High-Tech World remake any time soon.",Nintendo Life,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
45,"While the new graphics are gorgeous and being able to switch between old and modern visuals is great, Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX feels like three different games haphazardly slapped together. The level design and controls are fundamentally at odds with one another, and with how frequently you’ll die combined with how long it takes to respawn makes this simply a frustrating experience.",GamingTrend,"Jun 22, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
30,"Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX made for some of the most irritating platforming I’ve experienced in some time. With its slippery controls, large enemy hitboxes, and weak player attack, it’s miserable to play through the game’s stages (unless you turn on infinite lives, which kind of makes the game feel pointless). Since its look doesn’t improve the game, and the core game itself isn’t much fun, I can’t see anyone enjoying it besides the folks who grew up with it. And I can’t even see them sticking around for long when there are so many better offerings in the genre these days.",Siliconera,"Jul  5, 2021",Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,Switch
