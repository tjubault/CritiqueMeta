10 Second Ninja X,PlayStation 4,GameDesignDan,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2016-07-19,"If you want a cheesy story to go along with a hard platformer, this is for you! The game takes inspiration from Super Meat Boy, but faster paced. As the name implies, you have 10 seconds to finish the level. This is done by destroying every single robot (which there are a variety of), and not being electrocuted (which can also happen many ways). There are multiple ""stages"" that have multiple levels. These levels get progressively more difficult the more you complete, and each stage has it's own twist that changes how you play the game. Each stage also has different tilesets and music. In my opinion, the default control map is good, but be aware there is no control mapping. My only complaint is the learning curve. The levels, as I said, do get harder, but each time you enter a new stage, it becomes significantly more difficult, although I think that's the point. If you've never played a game like Super Meat Boy or 10 Second Ninja, you should definitely try this game.",76,Generally favorable reviews,11.0,5.0,0.0,5.5,Mixed or average reviews,8.0,3.0,6.0,55.0

Youll die at least 30 times just learning all of the traps. It will aggravate you and it may call for a break but any completionist will not be able to stay away too long and the crave of victory will soon be satitated. Once you do complete a level, you'll notice that with a complete understanding of the level's traps and flow it is rather simple to complete. Thus, begging you to get a faster time.If you love to speedrun. This game hits the nail on the head. Its 95% free of annoying gimmicks (darn that 5-3) and has many difficult secrets to give options on your run. Do you take the simple route and get your regular time? Or do you risk it all to shave 3 seconds? The choices!The game is also quite lengthy which is great! The second half of the game (as of this writing) has still yet to be recorded in a speed run world record (Good Luck!) !The only downfall of this second half is it fails in diversity. The first half of the game changes themes and schemes while the second remains a (seemingly endless) blue and white. 30 levels of blue and white can be tiresome! The good news is the soundtrack and gameplay improves in the second half. Gameplay is tighter, trickier, and you must be precise in your actions to master any level. The soundtrack for the whole game is catchy but it really ups the quality in the second half.Expect no gripping story, obviously but expect hours of death and reward. Your friends will think you a God when youre running through. And someone please speed run Antarctica!",78,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,2.0,0.0,6.6,Mixed or average reviews,21.0,7.0,8.0,66.0

Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Artdink,"['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG']",T,2017-07-07,"I won't spoil much here, and I'm going to give my views of this game, and as a fan of both shows. If you are fan of either show, then this game is worth checking out. That said, is it worth $60? I say it depends on how big of a fan you are. If you have seen every season and the movie for SAO, then it's worth it. They brought in a major character and outfits from Ordinal Scale. If you are into Accel World, then it's worth checking out since it's the first major adaptation they have done in 5 years. Furthermore, they bring in characters beyond the one season of anime since the books are still being published. In fact, they are characters from the books which aren't even published out West. They truly treat each franchise with respect, and they didn't make it another Kirito focus game where everyone else feels like a side kick. In fact the story provides solid air time for all major characters from each show. One key note, but I'm still playing the game and trying to beat the main story. I've put in a lot of hours to warrant a solid review since I've unlocked most characters and have advance into other parts of the world. I'm going to explain the story a bit, but the only spoilers I'm mentioning is the opening scene and explaining a few characters from Accel World since they are less known. The beginning of the game begins with Kirito, Asuna, and Yui. A warning message comes up indicating emergency server maintenance, and Yui begins to act weird thinking something is wrong. Kirito and Asuna lied about logging out, follow Yui, and this immediately things start go crazy around them. After following Yui they encounter Black Lotus and another major character who is the antagonist, and is nicknamed Persona. In the middle of this Yui gets captured/trapped, and after the introduction and confusion on who is ally and foe Black Lotus and Kirito put down their arms  realize they need to work together. Meanwhile the world of Alfheim rapidly changed with the town becoming a cyberpunk theme place, and around the open world there are red and distorted skyscrapers and modern buildings populating the landscape. This is when elements of Brain Burst, the main game in Accel World, are merging with Alfheim which is the main game world of SAO. Along the way they begin to search for their friends and answers, and eventually the roster of playable characters expands tremendously. I believe I almost got every playable character but one or two 15 hours into the game, and the current roster sits at around at least a couple dozen so far. Fortunately many characters get a decent amount of air time, and you can switch between any of the playable characters at portals, and some of the characters have their own side missions only available when you play as them. Unlike past SAO games from my experience they just make it mostly about Kirito, and that's it. In fact the story 15 hours in is mostly about the trying to save Yui, and figuring out what is going on with a lot of dialogue for all of the major character which include Kirito, Black Lotus, Asuana, Silver Crow, and even some of the side characters participate often including Sinon, Lisbeth, Cyan Pile, and the Red King to name a few. The story is mostly presented like a visual novel with still shots of the avatars talking to each other, and the voice acting is good. That said, the voices are in Japanese and it's sub. The only major complaint are some cutscenes have the sound is missing when swords/weapons clash. Otherwise, the presentation is good. Next is gameplay, and it's good. It's less stiff from previous games, and thanks to Accel World characters the combat feels fresh since their characters have different abilities and don't use swords. In fact it's more hand to hand combat with them, some have guns, and most can't fly. They rely on high jumps, and engaging in attacks in mid-air with their enemies. It takes a little time getting used to the jumping, but once you do it's fun playing the Accel World characters. Having a mix of characters from both words and their combat styles is fresh, and in my view the best out of the SAO games. Finally the last part is the world itself. It's mostly from Lost Song with a face lift. That is fine and all, but the graphics engine is out of date. It shows, and the only graphical impressive thing is the characters look great. Especially the Accel World avatars who are sci-fi and not fantasy oriented. Sadly though the world is bland, and while it's cool seeing skyscrapers and Brain Burst elements throughout the maps, but the world needs a new game engine and makeover. Overall it's a good game, and a must buy for fans of either series. It's not perfect since the camera angles can be wonky, and the graphics are outdated. Yet it's arguably the strongest SAO game, and Accel World is finally getting some deserved attention since it's very underrated in the anime world.",64,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,17.0,4.0,6.2,Mixed or average reviews,5.0,5.0,3.0,62.0

Albert & Otto: The Adventure Begins,PlayStation 4,Kbros Games,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E10+,2018-01-16,"Honestly, at first glance I figured Albert & Otto was going to be more of a rip-off than it ended up being. With a similar black and white aesthetic (albeit with a touch of red, reminiscent of Monochroma) and a silhouetted boy, I had a feeling I knew where this would go. But I was mistaken. This does a lot more than I anticipated from the little I saw prior to playing. The game starts by showing a girl that disappears in a flash, and you’re left in her stead. It’s up to you to figure out where she went, who she is, and how to save her. This game is actually the first episode in a series of four, and this particular entry follows Albert and Otto on their journey to Anna. Games in this genre often rely on environmental puzzles with very basic controls. A recent example of this is Planet of the Eyes. This does away with that idea, as you gain new abilities as you progress through the seven chapters of the game. Starting out you’re able to do the normal actions you’d come to expect, but are soon introduced to your weapon, a double jump, and even telepathy. The latter two abilities are tied to Otto, who you’ll pick up early on in the game. Otto also serves as an essential part of puzzle solving, as you can place him on the ground to hold down pressure plates, flip switches that are out of reach for Albert, amongst other things. This is a refreshing change, and while none of the puzzles had me wondering what to do for longer than 30 seconds, it was nice not having to just look for something I might’ve passed up the first time I went through an area. The game has collectibles for you to find in the form of pictures from Anna (the main story teller) as well as shards. The shards piece together a picture when you have them all, although you can probably figure it out long before you collect all 26. None of these are difficult to collect, although if you die you’ll likely want to verify you have it, because the game doesn’t save after collecting them in most cases. The game also sports a couple of boss battles, with one being more conventional while the other is more time sensitive and obvious as to what you need to do. Chances are that these are the parts of the game where you’ll die your first time through, as the majority of the game is pretty simple. There aren’t any real chase scenes, nor are there any moments of true dread. While I would actually sit up and feel my hands tense up as a dog would chase me in Inside, I sat back and relaxed my whole time with this game, as the puzzles were all able to be solved with minor exploration and an understanding of the tools available. The one part that may suggest a chase is more or less triggered whenever you reach certain points in the level, which negates any tension. Interestingly, one of the flaws in the game is something I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t die, as I realized that the game doesn’t always play out the same. It’s not that it’s meant to change, but sometimes the setup isn’t reset just right, or the physics are messed up. The first time I noticed this was during the first boss, when the boulder that was supposed to drop on his head went flying diagonally at me. It’s supposed to be propelled by gravity, and after I narrowly avoided it, the boss appeared to be stuck as if he acknowledged he should’ve taken a blow to the head. There are also a couple parts of the game that involve riding boxes over long stretches of water. At times these boxes didn’t allow Albert to stay on top of them, acting as if there was no friction, while at other times you can barely even walk across them and need to resort to jumping. Other physics systems in the game, especially in regards to the telepathy, seem to be a bit unpolished. I enjoyed the use of the mechanics, but couldn’t help but feel they could use a bit more work. The game’s double jump is incorporated in place of the climbing mechanic you would typically see in games like this. As much as I loved having a double jump, I couldn’t help but feel this took away some of the suspense and challenge away from the platforming. Albert & Otto takes the platforming puzzle genre in a fun direction while showing its inspiration on its sleeve. It’s not the best game you’ll play in the genre, but it’s a great setup for a much bigger story, and I can’t wait to see what lies in store for Albert, Otto, and Anna. The series has a lot of potential and is definitely worth a play through.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Amplitude,PlayStation 4,Harmonix Music Systems,"['Miscellaneous', 'Action', 'Rhythm', 'Music']",E,2016-01-05,"First off I played the original Amplitude back in the day and am familiar with the gameplay. The original games were $40 and this one is oddly $20. If you aren't a music rhythm game person, or only listen to one genre of music...this game probably isn't for you. If you like music, especially electronic music,  and like music rhythm games... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! It seems like Harmonix really focused on nailing the gameplay. Streaking is emphasized from the get go, and is the only real way to rack up points. There's new multiplayer modes (team play!). The ships are color coded better to tell each player apart. There's a new concept of ""Boss Songs"" where you have to maintain a streak to get through the gates without receiving damage. Really Fun!! Then there's the soundtrack.  I am an electronic music fan, and I love it! I see a lot of reviewers complain about not having any Weezer, or POD, or whatever but A. I don't think the reviewers ""get it"" - they don't get the cyber vibe of the game(I don't think that top 40 music would fit this game at all), and B. If I wanted to play those songs,  I would go play Rock Band. I'd rather hear something new and refreshing that was created for the experience!!! There are ""campaign"" songs and 15 unlocks. It seemed like they made the campaign songs about a narrative(more on that later). Each song has different genres infused into, like Electro,Breakcore, Drum n Bass, Techno, Dubstep, and even some that feel like Steve Reich, Rock, and Fleet Foxes. There's a ton of variation in here.  As you progress through each world, it seems like the tempo gets faster and faster. As you play through the campaign you unlock songs by Symbion Project (Concept is one of my favs), Freezepop, George and Jonathan, C418, etc.. a bunch of awesome indie electronic musicians which is really cool and un expected. Amplitude feels like a work of art, visually and audibly. It's a game focused around a crazy narrative about what I think is inducing synesthesia into someone, and have it go horribly wrong. You can tell the amount of work that went into crafting each world and song. It's really cool to see a company like Harmonix release a title like this in a time that most game company's don't want to take risks. I can't really complain much for a $20 game, but my minor annoyances are-No online multiplayerNo Remix modeA little grindy to unlock songs",74,Mixed or average reviews,30.0,28.0,1.0,7.5,Generally favorable reviews,23.0,10.0,4.0,75.0

Asemblance,PlayStation 4,Nilo Studios,"['Adventure', '3D', 'First-Person']",T,2016-06-21,"You wake up to blaring alarms — a red light dashes across your vision. The AI tells you that we are in an emergency situation, questioning why you aren’t helping. You rush for the terminal in front of you and everything goes dark. Blue lights flicker, the alarms silence and everything is immediately calm. How did I end up here? What is this place? How do I get out? This is the exact situation you find yourself in Nilo Studios’ fledgling game Asemblance. A first-person experience/psychological-thriller, Asemblance presents puzzles in both story and progression. The PC and PlayStation 4 game is a bit of an odd-ball; built for a relatively niche audience, the game rewards you by how far down the rabbit hole you are willing to dive. Neither the story nor the mechanics are spelled out directly, meaning it is up to the player to discover who you are, why you are there, and what everything means. Being as vague as I can, the game feels fairly heavily influence by P.T. and SOMA. Far more science fiction than horror, the game relies on the player to not only discover the story, but also to progress the game forward. The place you wake up in happens to be a memory holo-chamber: given the right input, you are able to explore your previous memories and interact with the environments. Unfortunately for the protagonist, the chamber has no exit doors and the AI seems vaguely malevolent, trying to prevent you from accessing certain memories. At no point is the player given express direction about where to go, how to unlock the next memory, or why you are even locked in a memory chamber. The answers are in the game, but requires a fair amount of sleuthing. The game takes places in only a handful of environments — roughly five — with scattered documents and messages around to give you an idea of what is happening. Like most first-person experience games, the controls are very basic. You are able to interact with a few objects, walk at a quicker pace, and zoom in on objects. And while this makes it sound like that doesn’t present enough variety, it is actually perfect. The game’s puzzle gets fairly challenging towards the end, so it is important to have direct knowledge about what the limits of your abilities are to impact the environment. Another thing to note is Asemblance is stunning — running in Unreal Engine 4, the limited environments presented are perfect down to every detail. From an office environment to an impeccable apartment to a woody grove, it is one of the best looking games on the PlayStation 4 (especially for its $9.99 price tag). There are the rare visual blips that are fairly noticeable, only because everything around it is so perfect. The game features multiple endings, each progressively more difficult to find than the last. As far as I understand, I’m (currently) the only reviewer to find the fourth ending, and no one has been able to find the fifth. This is the kind of scavenger hunt I love to see in games — it is what made P.T. so much fun, and the recent Resident Evil 7 demo so infuriating. In creating a puzzle so rigorous, the developer is either implicitly or explicitly asking players to discuss the game further, talk strategies, and pull out their hair collectively. The only true downside (at least with the four of five endings I’ve seen) is they are entirely too similar. While there are some small dialogue variations attached to each of them, experiencing the endings never felt rewarding. Thankfully, the puzzle itself (and the accompanying trophies) were rewarding in and of itself. To add to that, I mentioned the game’s audience is relatively niche — many people don’t play games to be intellectually challenged, or for a dense, puzzling story. The game is technically beatable in 15-20 minutes if you are going for the more basic ending. Meanwhile, I have spent roughly six or seven hours reading through the many documents strewn around, investigating each object, and trying to decipher how to unlock all the endings. I’m hesitant to call Asemblance “fun” — but that isn’t what the game is trying to be. Instead, it is a challenge to overcome for those interested in experimental gameplay and hidden stories. The game is dense, but rewarding for those looking to make the investment. The fact of the matter is, there aren’t a ton of experiences like this around on PlayStation 4 (perhaps with the exception of SOMA): puzzle-driven psychological thrillers are fairly scarce.

Axiom Verge,PlayStation 4,Tom Happ,"['Sci-Fi', 'Action Adventure', 'General']",E10+,2015-03-31,"Axiom Verge was a treat to play and with almost 30 hours invested into it I still have more weapons, areas and unlockables to uncover. The game from the beginning has a very noticeable Metroid meets Contra in the belly of Red Falcon sort of feel and I have to say that I love it. One thing right off the bat that this game gets right is the basic controls. Firing your weapon in all directions felt just as smooth as an NES or SNES side scrollers without that weightiness present in most games. Jumping and firing on enemies with the sound effects and enemy explosions felt satisfying. A very easy game to pick up and immediately start playing. The story is best described as a complex science fiction tale where a scientist named Trace supposedly dies in a lab explosion only to awaken unharmed in an alien world. Armed with a biomechanical gun and tasked by a female voice in his mind, Trace runs out into this mysterious world searching for answers while trying not get killed in the process. The game is filled with weapons, health and weapons upgrades, unique enemies, boss battles and of course secret areas. Each world is interconnected by portals or breaches in structures where you must fight enemies and find that specific upgrade to continue on. One of my favorite upgrades might have to be the mechanical drone. This little laser armed critter can get to hard to reach areas or tunnels all the while Trace is protected under a barrier shield. A very useful way to clear the path of enemies in tight situations. A later upgrade even allows you to increase the launch distance of the drone as well as allow you to teleport to its location making traversing areas quicker. The laser drill attachment also acquired near the begin is also a beautiful tool for passing through rocky areas and enemies. The music feels like a love letter to the chiptune styles of the NES and SNES and do I love the design choice.  The constant loop does bring back nostalgic feelings, however, I feel the sound was spot on for the atmosphere and style of the game. Of course, what appears to be pretty straight forward good vs evil side scrolling shooter evolves into an existential drama of dark events and discovery of who you really are – as well as the motives of your enemy and allies.  It is certainly complex and will get you pondering afterwards – however, there are quite a few hidden documents and notes that you can uncover and translate to find out what has been transpiring. I will not lie that some of it can be confusing, however, its complexity and winding nature kept me piqued. Whether a gamer loves it or hates it will be one’s story telling preferences methinks. If there were any issues, I would say that the dashing teleporting mechanic which later serves as a quick dash to break through walls or access alternate paths or double jump can be a little hard to master when trying to access overhead areas. I found it was best used in tandem with a grappling hook accessory.  In addition, the weapon wheel used to select your full arsenal in game vs. during a pause can be a little difficult to direct especially as you gain more weapons  – however, none of these were deal breakers. Also, anyone looking for someone to hold your hand, this is most likely not the game for you. Although you get save points in each map, there is no regenerative health (you have to earn it) and only one life.  There are no glowing indicators telling you exactly where to go (although colors exist on the map for potentially red boss rooms, light blue save rooms, or areas of importance) and you cannot teleport between worlds. You have to trek it out on foot or with your upgrades.  However, there are some hidden drops and one fast mode of travel in a specific area if a gamer discovers it. In addition, sometimes you will get trapped in a world with no option other than to go deeper into it. To me, it is my favorite environmental choice – forcing you to explore the rich environments, only to find another powerup to access other areas as well as allow you to finally backtrack to the previous worlds. As for the supposed “glitches” that appear on screen (another throwback to the NES days), these are actually intentional. A later upgrade called the Address Disruptor allows you to manipulate not only these glitchy environments to open up new areas but also change the attack patterns and forms of your enemies - sometimes even allowing them to spawn energy to refill your health. All of this (the game, soundtrack and story) developed by one man over a span of 5 years is astonishing in my opinion and shows how an indie game or any game can be done well with a great attention to detail and love for the genre. I only think what Tom Happ could do with a large team and bigger budget. If you have a PS4, I think it is a no brainer to get it, just be aware of what you are getting into.",84,Generally favorable reviews,55.0,6.0,0.0,8.0,Generally favorable reviews,136.0,23.0,20.0,80.0

Batman: Arkham VR,PlayStation 4,Rocksteady Studios,"['Action', 'General']",M,2016-10-11,"The single most incredible gaming experience I have ever had since a friend first gave me floppy disks of Doom 24 years ago. It is hard to describe. I have tried another PS4 VR game, Robinson's Journey, which is fine, but Batman somehow convey a sense of weight and substance to the environments and characters that makes everything seem much more as if it is really there. You just feel overwhelmed and surrounded by a gritty but beautiful city - everything from the fallen leaves and rain puddles to the zeppelins overhead, to the bricks inches from your eyes as you stand on a fire escape peering into windows, to the strength and substance of Nightwing and Robin who are perfectly animated in the most natural way possible - it must all be motion capture. This is not even to mention the beautiful lighting and sound. Right away with the opening, witnessing Batman's origin as your parents fall dead to your left and right is the most meaningful way to experience that origin tragedy.  The use this game makes not only of the VR headset, but of the move controllers which have you reaching and turning objects in the game, taking things from and handing things to other characters, as well as the use the game makes of the PS4 camera which allows you to literally in the real world walk left to right about 7 feet and front to back as far back as my living room allowed before I hit the sofa, also lends a visceral sense that you are really in this other palpable credible concrete place. The gameplay is not Arkham City or Arkham Asylum gameplay. This is not an action game. It is traditional point-and-click style adventure game where you move around first person MYST style (except for the area in which you can actually walk back and forth and toward and away from the camera), utilizing gameplay where you search for and put together clues including one cool scene in which you reassemble a smashed bomb detonator by manipulating the broken pieces with your hands and put them together like a 3D jigsaw puzzle. I almost didn't buy this game due to the MYST style movement but now I realize it is to prevent nausea which, in VR games, can become a real issue. I was unprepared for how much that MYST style movement just did not bother me, partly because within a small area you always can walk around. The game is short but when you consider the sheer massive amount of detail - more than in any game I've ever seen - you realize that a great deal of work went into this. I prefer a shorter game that is so strikingly beautiful and full of minute detail, over a longer more stylized game with simplified environments. Finally, the puzzles are enjoyable but not very difficult. I would prefer a choice of difficulty levels that makes puzzles more difficult on the harder setting. The voice acting, including Mark Hammill as The Joker, is as good as it gets. The character animations are perfect. My strong advice is to get this game.",74,Mixed or average reviews,38.0,24.0,0.0,7.2,Mixed or average reviews,89.0,19.0,27.0,72.0

Battle Worlds: Kronos,PlayStation 4,KING Art,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'General']",E10+,2016-04-26,"There's only one word to sum this game up. Boring. Nothing about the game is responsive or feels good about controlling it. The enemy turn takes WAY too long, even on the first mission when they only have like 5 units. Now, I have to preface the rest of this with something. I like strategy games. I enjoy thinking my moves out and planning ahead, using the environment to my advantage, all things this game claims you need to succeed. Do you know what you don't get though? All of the information. Within the first ten minutes of gameplay they teach you how to capture buildings via tutorial. HOWEVER, if you're not reading the pages and pages of expanded text, you'll miss crucial information. Like how the D-pad opens up a unit/building specific menu, and that through this menu you can deploy additional troops from a certain type of building. Information that would have been useful three turns ago when they game taught you about buildings and not when you start asking yourself why the enemy has heavy tanks and you don't. This is all bundled on top of some of the worst console optimization I've ever seen in a port. Now that your unit has used every action it has for the turn, wouldn't you like to move to another unit? Well, I certainly hope you remember to press O every single time, otherwise you stay on that first unit. This wouldn't be the worst thing if it didn't lead me to moving units I didn't want to move. Oh, and for whatever stupid reason, either because the game is for ""hardcore veterans"" or bad design choices, you can't back a unit up. That's right, it's turn based, but you can't cancel a move. You can pull a piece back in CHESS, the most intellectual game man has made, but Battle Worlds Kronos says that's dumb, mistakes don't happen ever, right? Oh, and for my last piece. A section of the tutorial explains that this game is hard because ""there are too many easy games already."" Well, that may be true, but I have to say, there are difficult games that are a LOT more fun than this.

The only problem I have is that maybe 3 of them from the 4 are to vehicle based. Silk road should be called 'get in a tank and go to the next location'. Only one of the maps is decent for infantry and that is Guilin Peaks. Altai range and Dragon pass are also vehicle centric . I can forgive them tho as the capture points feel quite well spaced out so you never feel as far from the action (and as out in the open ) as you do in Silk road. Dragon's pass is the most beautiful level not just in China rising but in the game period....closely followed by Guilin peaks. Maybe I am just a sucker for trees and mountains tho. Overall if you got it for free how can you complain? If you paid for premium then the money is worth it alone just for the infantry action in Guilin or the scenery in Dragon Pass.

Blazblue has an amazing story and an interesting fighting system I manage to put 130 hours in all three of them and I enjoyed every single minute of it. The cons are that you have to play the other 2 blazblue games to understand the story and that the end of blazblue is not yet revealed so if you love the story just like me you will have to buy the next blazblue when it is out. All in all I think blazblue is a great game and a god damn cheep one if you ask me all three of them cost 60$ so if you should go out and buy this game now even if you don't like fighting games the story is more than enough for you,80,Generally favorable reviews,9.0,0.0,1.0,7.6,Generally favorable reviews,24.0,6.0,5.0,76.0

Bleed 2,PlayStation 4,BootdiskRevolution,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2018-02-06,"When I (Chad) originally reviewed Bleed a few months ago, I hated it. It was not a complete disaster, but it was far from anything spectacular. Having spent a good deal of time with the sequel, Bleed 2, I feel like the complaints I had on the original were taken to heart and the follow-up was made specifically for me. The story picks up after the ending of the original, with an alien terror attacking the unnamed city that our heroine Wryn resides in. Quickly running head first into battle, she’s faced with 7 new levels of platforming and shooting shenanigans. Each level features a style reminiscent of the Super Nintendo era filled with bright colors and much more inspired enemies. While there’s not a huge selection of standard baddies to battle, there are a number of new boss battles which make up the meat of the game, as each level features a few bosses to tackle. This mode is much more accessible than the previous entry due to unlimited lives being offered and a very forgiving checkpoint system, with some boss battles featuring mid battle checkpoints. That being said, the normal difficulty here is more akin to the easy mode on the original. With a total of 4 difficulties, each with their own associated unlocks and leader boards, there is a decent amount of replay value here despite the short campaign which can be completed in under an hour. If you’re looking for more of a challenge there is an Arcade mode, which only offers one life; a 3 vs 1 boss battle option; and a rogue-lite mode that features randomized levels/enemies, each with a boss to finish them out. While some games shoe horn this mode in, with Bleed 2 it works beautifully, although it is a bit more difficult than the main game. These randomized levels look and feel like you are playing a Mega Man mod and feature traps that are nowhere to be found in the main game. This is by no means a bad thing, though it will take some serious practice to make any type of progress as there are no continues. Add in the ability to use different weapons or additional characters you unlock and the replay options are endless. The new characters and weapons that you’ll unlock change up the game in some pretty fun ways. Some characters are limited to their stock attack and feature new abilities, and there are new weapons that The Rival or Wryn can use. Each variation will require you to play a little differently, with each character or weapon excelling at specific situations and will make others a bit more difficult. I personally had a great deal of fun speed running through the game with the rocket launcher, which essentially makes most of the bosses powerless, even beating a few ignoring their battle specific mechanics entirely. Bleed 2 controls much better than the original, as I was able to easily get into the habit of jumping multiple times and was soon using the slow motion ability like a pro. I did struggle a bit at first, as the pop up tutorials are not always as in depth as I would prefer.  My biggest issue is the requirement to go into the menu and manually change your character’s weapons, as there is no easy option to do so during gameplay. While this is not overly cumbersome, it does ruin the sense of momentum that shines throughout the rest of the title. Couch co-op is much more enjoyable than in the original game, partially due to the game being less reliant on the platforming aspect and focusing more on shooting, making it much easier to keep track of the second player. I did get mildly frustrated playing as one of the bosses, as it can be hard to determine which of the characters is the player and which is the boss. While these instances are few and far between, it does make the experience slightly less enjoyable. With Bleed 2 fixing a number of the annoying aspects from the original, I wholeheartedly recommend this title for anyone who is looking for a new bullet-hell type shooter with loads of replayability.",0,No score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It only works well on Domination and even then it turns into a long range camp fest. It's a frustrating map that doesn't flow right. Heartland is a remake from the god awful Ghosts. Yes its as bad as it was back then. Carnage again looks nice, set at a race track in the woods (which I originally thought was a music festival) but suffers from vast useless empty spaces and multiple camper spots. Depot 22 feels like it was made in an IW map creator mode by a kid. It recycles from the weaker IW maps like Crusher. Its another large slow map with nothing exciting to shout about. Like I said, its a real shame since the last map pack encouraged all out melee brawls where any play-style suited the maps. This one however favors long range weapons only. Obviously some idiot dev loves Ghosts and got their wish to create maps in the same style. Unfortunately we all suffer. So unless you bought the sesson pass, dont bother wasting cash on the forth and final map pack. You'll be very disappointed unless you were one of the few who foolishly enjoyed Ghosts.",0,No score yet,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0

Call of Duty: WWII - The Resistance,PlayStation 4,Sledgehammer Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Arcade']",M,2018-01-30,"The Resistance is a very weak DLC. It feels as if it should have been free considering the main game only comes with 8 Multi-player maps.The DLC comes with 2 new MP maps, 1 remaster from MW3 and 1 War map. The two new MP maps have now provided the game with the correct amount of maps WW2 should have had at launch, a very pricey addition to the COD franchise when you add it all up.The resistance also comes with a zombies map, which I don't play but I'm sure will please the many fans who play COD just for zombies. Out of the two new maps you get, one is okay the other absolutely terrible, meaning for 11.99 you get one map worth playing and a map from MW3 which was remastered last year in COD IW so hardly feels fresh and exciting. Occupation:Occupation is a remaster of the map Resistance from MW3. It was remastered again last year in COD IW with a few twists that made it work well with the exo abilities and movement, it worked very well and was a welcome return, so why did Sledgehammer remaster the map again? Bizarrely the IW remaster was only released in July 2017, less than 6 months ago. There's so many brilliant past maps to choose from to remaster such as Favela MW2, Scrapyard MW2 or Quarry MW2 it really does show a lack of creativity from Sledgehammer. Despite the odd choice to remaster Resistance again, it's the best map in the DLC. Which says a lot. It plays well on all modes and flows well. Lag does ruin many of the games but when you finally find a good lobby with limited lag it's a great map. Valkyrie:Valkyrie is the second best map. Set in and around a series of bunkers and surrounding woods the map is based on The Wolfs Lair which was Hitler's Eastern-Front headquarters. The map plays well on most modes, has a good flow, and sticks to the classic 3 route structure. Graphically the map is good with some nice use of colour due to the surrounding greenery. Anthropoid:This is the worst map in the DLC and possibly now the worst map in the game. It's an illogical mess. There are way to many angles to get shot from. Most of the time you run round aimlessly without encountering anyone only to be shot be a camper in a building or sat in a corner. It plays badly on all modes and only really favors long range weapons. There's way to many flanking routes,head glitch spots and random corners and angles. The flow is completely off and most players just camp. War map - Operation Intercept:This is another poor map. It's lifeless and dull and has little character. It feels smaller than the other war maps and there's only one way to play it. Thinking is not encouraged as the map is just a series of three very tight choke points. You just need to charge and hope the enemy isn't a team of campers, otherwise you are not going to be having much fun. You'll likely play it only 3 or 4 times before never playing again. Little has been done to fix the lag issues and the DLC is no better. You never know when you will shoot first and die first and 90% of deaths are due to poor hit detection and lag. It's a very frustrating experience. There are no free weapons with the DLC or skins. This is it. 2 new maps, a remaster that's been done twice before and a dreadful, unoriginal War map. For 3.99 I'd feel this DLC was almost a fair price, but 11.99 is a rip off.",73,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,4.0,0.0,2.4,Generally unfavorable reviews,1.0,1.0,8.0,24.0

I mean it's good not to be instakilled so quickly but I you have too much health that it takes too long to kill someone. Anyway the other issue that was obvious was there way no online multiplayer which this game really could use. They said it was cause the game did not originally have that and adding it would be to expensive at this point. Of course that didn't mean they didn't want to.

Children of Zodiarcs,PlayStation 4,Cardboard Utopia,"['Role-Playing', 'Japanese-Style']",T,2017-07-18,"This is a niche game, and they tend to be subjected to poor User Reviews.  However, strategy role-players just happen to be my favorite category.  I am a huge fan of the genre.  I started with Shining Force on the Sega Genesis, and have been playing every SRPG I can get my hands on since then.  With that being said, even I was hesitant to spend the money on this title after reading some of these reviews.  The complaints (unfinished game, long fights, impossible odds), had me legitimately concerned.  I’m glad I decided to take a chance on it – Children of Zodiarcs turned out to be quite fun with some addictive layers of strategy.  It is definitely not for everyone, though. The game borrows elements from previous SRPGs and collectible card games like Magic the Gathering.  On the surface, the game has the look of a stripped down variant that takes place on a grid style battlefield.  I felt the small party size (three) and the absence of finding new weapons and armor a bit lacking. There are no items (potions, healing herbs, etc.) to speak of.  Instead, you unlock new cards for each of your characters, and find new dice for them to equip. The game really deviates itself from the standard with its cards and dice mechanics.  Instead of picking from a list of abilities, what your character can do in a turn is determined by the available cards in hand.  This action is then modified by rolling the dice.  Depending on which symbols turn up, your character will be awarded certain things like bonus damage and bonus healing.  There are even symbols for drawing more cards and taking an extra action.  I found myself vested in each roll, because you are allowed to choose up to two dice to reroll once per round.  This is a pleasant change from the redundancy of pixelated dice rolling than can be found in other games.  I was forced to prioritize my reroll options by what my character needed most at any given time.  Should I go for max damage, or do I need more cards?  Should I try to squeeze out another action, or get the symbols required to activate a secondary ability on the card I just played?  Sometimes I needed three or four of these things to happen at once, so that I can turn the tide of the battle, or just continue to stay afloat.  When I was able to engineer such a feat, it was quite satisfying. Of course, the dice doesn’t allows go in your favor, and sometimes you will not get rolls or the cards that are needed to win.  I can see how this randomness can be off putting to some.  The key is maximizing your odds by equipping the best suited cards and dice (each character can equip different dice to a certain amount of slots).  Even taking these precautions doesn’t always guarantee victory.  You will be responsible for constructing the decks, so there will be trial and error while you figure out which cards work best, and which dice compliment them.  The lengths of the battles are indeed long, but this is nothing new to the genre.  If you aren’t fighting a battle, what else are you going to do in the game?  It is not like you will unlock a first person shooter portion of the game once you knock out all these ‘silly turned based fights’.  If you are like me, the grid based combat drew you to the game in the first place.  As far as the game being impossible due to overwhelming odds, I can see that being the case if you are under leveled, but that’s what the skirmishes are for.  Beefing up my squad in this manner didn’t feel like a grind to me.  I was excited to see what new card I would get after leveling up.  Sometimes, characters are awarded new dice after a battle, though I have yet to figure out what mechanic this is tied to, if any.  The EXP awarded during skirmishes is sufficient (even better for elite skirmishes) especially if you are pushing each character to do as much as possible each turn.  EXP is awarded for every action (playing a card), not just dealing the killing blow.  I realize that I am in the minority of folks that enjoy this aspect of the game, but I certainly wouldn’t call it broken. As I mentioned, only three characters in the party does seem lacking.  Not because it is too hard, but since the cards are character/class specific, and seeing some more variety would be great.  It has a solid foundation, and the possibilities to improve are certainly there for a second installment.  I would love to see four or five characters to a party tied into FFTs job system, or something similar.  Being able to unlock new classes and new abilities along with the current ones would certainly add to the replay value. That being said, Children of Zodiarcs holds up pretty darn well in its current form.  As I stated, it is a niche game, and it certainly won’t win over any new fans to the genre (like FF7 did for JRPGs).  However, if strategy role playing games have always been your thing, then you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.",81,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,2.0,0.0,5.3,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,0.0,6.0,53.0
Chime Sharp,PlayStation 4,Chilled Mouse,"['Puzzle', 'General']",E,2017-02-21,"Chime SharpA game with just as much potential as it has problems…Chime sharp is a music meats Tetris styled puzzle game...The concept is simple.. make blocks, cover the board, increase your score while the game reads your shapes as notes…There are 16 different levels here that are unlocked as you get high enough scores on precious levels… all with 4 different modes to change the gameplay up that aren’t unlocked until you master the previous mode…And mastering these modes are very hard to do because of the games underlying problems…This is a puzzle game.. But the rounds go by so fast that I never felt I was using my brain...I was reacting, frantically rotating shapes and placing them trying to create blocks and fill up the score bar at the bottom…I felt there was never time for me to think ahead...Because of this I never felt I was making progress with the game… just that I was mindlessly going through levels getting lucky while some cool music played in the background…Another issue I have that also stops any feeling of progression is that every board gives you different shapes to use and it doesn’t tell you the shapes that level uses beforehand so you have no idea what to build for or how you should be setting up slots for future shapes..To be fair, you can eventually memorize the shapes for each level and make a note yourself... though you shouldn’t have to... but you can...But even if you do so, this will hardly matter for some levels because the difficulty of them are based solely on the color scheme of these levels…as you clear blocks they change colors and in some stages the color matches too closely with your shape in hand so it’s hard to see where you’re placing anything…Chime Sharp is a cool idea…But the timer is too fast.. It’s sometimes too hard to see the board… and the game constantly changes the rules without telling you…It’s an alright puzzle game… definitely a challenge…but for all of the wrong reasons.I give Chime Sharpa 6/10",76,Generally favorable reviews,5.0,4.0,0.0,2.9,Generally unfavorable reviews,2.0,4.0,9.0,29.0

Comet Crash 2: The Kronkoid Wars,PlayStation 4,Pelfast,"['Strategy', 'General']",E10+,2017-08-08,"Short version :I loved the first one(on PS3). I played it a LOT.The 2nd one, on PS4, uses the same recipe. Same units, same techs, samedefense towers.But new maps. And some gameplay and graphic tweaks here and there.In this case, that is exactly how it should be !  This is perfect. Long version :It's a tower defense combined with RTS with very little other games to compare it to.  You control a ship that you use to gather money and build defense towers.  Build locations are not fixed so you need to ""create a patern"" to guide the ennemy's units.  Your ship can be destroyed by the ennemy's Anti-Air defense (only minimal consequences.  You loose some passive boosts and respawn quickly.  Just enough to make you ""try to not crash""...) You also need to build ""unit generators"" to generate an army and attack the ennemy.  It's original and works awesomely well. This is best played in Co-op (Couch co-op!).  But there is also online co-op and PvP.  The whole campaign can be played @ 3 player coop. There's a constant progression as you play through the campaign.  Every few missions, a new technology is revealed.  You usually have to face that new technology in the hand of the AI ennemy.  Then you unlock it and you try it in the next mission.  And so on for all techs.  And you get new ones all the way through the campaign. There's 4 levels of difficulty, going from ""walk in the park"" to ""VERY hard""... specially if you aim at ""perfect matches"" (5 stars requires to not loose a single HP on your base). Specially since patch 1.01.  ( I actually exchanged a few emails with the developer himself on the subject of difficulty and some fixes were applied in patch 1.01 according to our conversation ! ) It begins smooth (in the first mission, you have access to 1 offensive unit type and 2 types of defensive towers, and you play on a very small map.  As you progress through the campaign, you get more and more technologies to play with, with bigger and bigger maps, with harder, more aggressive AI.  You eventually need to combine different offense and defense strategies, including forcing the ennemy units to ""turn around"" in your defense system (open a path and close another one to force the ennemies to turn around and walk through your defense a second time). You can even destroy ennemy's tower defense (build a stronger tower near theirs... and repair yours untill theirs is destroyed...) to open new paths for your own army... Graphics are basic/simple, but pretty.  Everything runs smoothly.  This game is developped by a very small indie dev team(Pelfast).  They clearly used their ressources at their fullest and built something amazing.  They clearly built this with a lot of love !  A hidden gem ! I... just.... love it !",72,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

That said, it's not a cash-in, it's a heartfelt, and well thought out game, that harks back to an era that makes my nostalgic muscles twitch to no end. Phantasy Star, Lunar, Chrono Trigger, Suikoden. I could keep listing, if you've been around for long enough, or haven't but still loved these games, this game is for you, no question about it. The battle system is excellent; interesting to work with, at Heroine difficulty (the 3rd of the 4, which I recommend playing it on) - it really pushes you to think a few moves ahead with each character, and as a whole team, to ultimately get extremely satisfying results once you figure out that tactic for each fight. It's not just the boss fights that are interesting, every fight is, and as you progress, level up, get more gear and get wiser, you enjoy it more, you're rewarded for being a good player and a tactician in the field of battle. I love it. The characters are charming, with a zany sense of humor that is reminiscent of that in the Lunar series. Zeboyd know how to handle subtle references, and they know how to handle humor, so there are a few good times I've both smiled and laughed out loud. There's a wealth of NPCs with funny tidbits here and there to share, as well as being useful for tips on battle, items, techniques, and quest clues. It's all in the world around you, you just need to look. The resolution at 1920x1080 is NOT blurry - i'm playing on a 43"" TV at 1080 and it looks terrific, so I can wholeheartedly say that's not true at all. I've not had any stages where my game save has become corrupt, nearly 16 hours in now and I've not encountered any bugs, actually. That said, they're there, I've spoken to others, and I've seen them. However the developers have patched since these other rancid reviews were posted, and are working to another patch extremely soon. Rather than slate the developers in to the ground, these users could have reported the bugs, yes stil be annoyed because a buggy game is an annoying game, but at the very least communicate that frustration to the developers. They're not trying to get away with anything, they're 4 years in on a labor of love and they could have used more time, yes, but they didn't have it, so whatever small bugs are being encountered, and big ones, they've tackled most of them already and are weeding out the remainders. The story is good, characters are charming, the artwork is fantastic and the overall aesthetic will pull you in if you've a nostalgic bone in your body. At an estimated 15-20 hours gameplay, for the price of $14.99 (currently $11.99 for another 24 hours I think) you cannot ask for better value for money. People raging on this game at the loud minority, and I only wish people who have played and enjoyed the game thoroughly would speak up for their experiences, both good and bad, but at some way to support the vision of CSH and the development team, tiny a team as it is. If you're not sure, watch some playthrough of it on youtube, but if you are liking it, stop watching, and go grab it, to avoid spoilers.",76,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,2.0,0.0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,26.0,6.0,8.0,71.0

The bowling has been slightly tweaked but essentially apart from looking at the meters slightly different it remains basically the same. The graphics look a lot better than what they were and the introduction into the career mode of club cricket is a good one and letting you develop through the teams. I suppose this is all about expectations really. If you imagine it will be as polished a game as the suite of EA games then you would be wrong. However if you loved DBC 14 and love cricket in general then this is certainly a game you'd want to play.

The gameplay is very different as it is now more of a hack and slash RPG. For the most part, it can be a lot of fun trying out each character and their unique set of skills. Unfortunately, the boss battles are not very fun at all. I found that hey would drag on for too long, especially since most attacks from a boss will nearly kill you, which means you'll have to play it safe and wait for the right moment to attack. This also means you can't use most magic users since spells take too long to cast and only leave you open to attack (plus whichever character you control at the time will be targeted by the boss). The highlights for me are the large scale battles with many enemies spawning from portals which you have to stop. You have to make use of various tools to keep your allies alive while also stopping the enemies.",76,Generally favorable reviews,53.0,15.0,0.0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,35.0,5.0,11.0,74.0

Energy Invasion,PlayStation 4,Sometimes You,"['Action', 'Arcade']",E,2018-01-10,"If there’s a genre that you probably wouldn’t expect to take off, it’d be the brick breaker. I have nothing against games like Arkanoid, but there’s not a whole lot of room for improvement. At least, that’s probably your initial thought. Recent years have brought some fantastic titles with the brick breaking base, such as Sidhe’s Shatter and Tribute Games’ Wizorb. As something that many new developers typically make as their first game, I’m always intrigued by what kind of new content people bring to the tried and true formula. The gimmick behind Energy Invasion isn’t that you break blocks with the ball you bounce back and forth, but rather with projectiles that ball emits. Essentially, the ball serves as a vehicle that you’ll be using to shoot from. So instead of merely aiming the ball, you’ll be timing the shots from the ball in directions with the right stick. Is there a block to the left of the ball? Shoot to the left. Are you above a ton of blocks bouncing between them and the ceiling? Shoot down. It’s nothing drastically different from the norm, other than the fact you’ll be utilizing a second analog stick. There are a few modes here, although none of them differ all that much. Invasion features enemies that will shoot projectiles that will kill you if they make contact. There are also some interesting graphical changes later on that will remove all your projectiles and probably result in your death as it’s much more difficult to see what’s happening unless you are prepared. Linear mode is basically invasion but without any of the extra difficulties. And like any game such as this, there’s an endless mode for those that want to just break some bricks. Once you die, you’ll see your score and where you place on the leaderboards. The amount of lives you are provided is generous as you progress through the game, although I can’t tell you when exactly you earn new lives. The game also has power-ups such as a bar that keeps you from needing to hit the projectile, as well as an extended paddle, but again, these aren’t obviously attainable. It just so happened I got them after breaking a block at random. If you die, some blocks will require more hits to destroy them, thus extending the life of the level and making you work for that life you just lost – these are the only obvious visual change. Perhaps a weird complaint, but one I realized I had while playing the linear mode – without seeing my score constantly while playing, I didn’t feel any sort of compulsion to keep playing. Seeing that with a “next highest score” sort of thing would drive me to keep progressing, but I found myself getting bored halfway through the levels (which I knew after quitting and seeing I had finished about 50% of them – my score didn’t count because I quit though). The soundtrack is fine, but it doesn’t grab me in the same way that Shatter‘s soundtrack did (or still does, as I have it in regular rotation in my music library). The visuals aren’t spectacular or out to do anything especially different, but they work for what the game is and does. Controls are about as basic as they come, although the shooting frequency can at times be sporadic and not necessarily make sense to the player without extensive time with the game – these are likely caused by power-ups and power-downs. If you’re hankering for a new brick breaking title, Energy Invasion is definitely an option you can consider. But if you are looking for something truly different in the genre and haven’t played the aforementioned titles in the opening paragraph, I’d say you should play those first. If you still need some bricks to break, then you can hop into this.",0,No score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.8,Overwhelming dislike,0.0,1.0,3.0,18.0

Unfortunately a few really big issues really make it hard to justify playing this game despite the free price point.The gameplay, environments, and graphics are all done well. The user interface is absolutely awful though and needs a major overhaul. Despite going through a tutorial that took way too long, the game fails to really explain most of the user interface especially in menus. This makes it more difficult than it should be to switch between stores, look at new equipment, compare prices and stats on items, etc. Some options fail to work half the time, giving the game the feel of a bad port.Also, even though you will spend awhile unlocking individual pieces of your kit, that nice shiny new gear you just purchased has to be constantly repaired to keep it functioning properly.The load times don't anything are pretty extensive, and often the game freezes during the process.I would say that this game had so much more potential that it feels like it'll never achieve because of it's okay to win feel.

The controls and interactions are that stupid and pointless, that I'd rather preferred not having controls or interaction at all. Graphically the Unreal Engine is much more powerful than this crap. And the different ""stages"" are reeeeeally boring. Maybe with some motion graphics and better explanation videos it could be as interesting as I expected, but nope.

Fallen Legion: Sins of an Empire,PlayStation 4,YummyYummyTummy,"['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG']",E10+,2017-07-18,"So I just finished the game and now I'm going back and revising the quick review I had previously made.  After 4 hours I thought this game was a gem, a pearl, a treasure. This game is $20 and if you preordered, technically $7 since you got this and the other game for $14.  So all criticisms of the games production and scope will be viewed through that lens.So down the gambit: Visuals are good. Voice acting is good but you do have to read some since this is a $20 indie title (not a drawback for me.) Gameplay is really good, simple, and different from what many are accustomed to. Controls are good except it takes a minute to get used to the real time ""turn"" system which is not actually a turn system. It's hard to explain.  Eventually you figure it out and thus adequately blocking becomes possible (not for some reviewers, geesh, crapping on this whole game because they can't block.)  The lore is actually REALLY good. You have to think about it. You have to read about it in the menu, which for some reason was enjoyable. My FAVORITE part is the writing.  It is highly intelligent and actually had me googling words I've heard maybe once or never in my life. It also had me pondering philosophical concepts in order to properly interpret the foundations of this game's universe, which I love.There is almost a rhythm to the battle system for which ""cooldown"" to hit and when.  The different combatants have different lengths of cooldowns and thus it's a management meta game of how to string together the longest combo to keep your enemy at bay and avoid too much damage.  Enjoyment is further added to this when the ""turn slots"" of this non-turn-system have certain designations where whoever you chose to attack in that slot gets a powered up attack, so you get another level of strategy in this non-RTS-RTS (dont hate lol) and even that is customizable.So that was mostly my thoughts after 4 hours, and after approximately 15 I can't say much has changed.  The only complaint I have is that it gets a little repetitive toward the middle, but honestly what game doesn't?  Almost every AAA game I've played in the last 5 years has been getting you to repeat the same tasks over and over in different locations and with different context.  This game is great, kinda has an arcade feel to it. The story is actually really good. It does what a story should do, and the ending you see coming is not actually the ending you get, which is nice.

The mythology and backstory that slowly unfold honestly matches the level and scope of something like the Star Wars trilogy. It's about family, love, society, belief, and friendship. It's deep, philosophical, metaphysical and more than anything emotional.

We are transported to another world with enough culture and detail to believe it's just an alternate reality. The architecture and landscape design are colorful, vibrant, highly innovative and full of life. The most mind-blowing thing about it is how great the graphics still look in 2016, 15 years after its initial release. The game looks just as good in HD as you would want it to. The FMV cut-scenes are still just as breathtaking and enjoyable to watch as they were in 2001, which is something I didn't expect. The option to switch between the original score and the new arranged one is something that die-hard fans will seriously appreciate. If you were a fan of the original, you must pick up this remaster. If you've never played this game before, then you need to stop what you're doing, close this window, go out and buy this game and experience the timeless classic that is Final Fantasy X. Oh...and the sequel was fun.",84,Generally favorable reviews,26.0,4.0,0.0,8.3,Generally favorable reviews,267.0,17.0,39.0,83.0

Last but not least, the music is great, it totally fits Gladio's personality and the dark dungeon setting, and the final boss theme is a masterpiece. On my first playthrough, it took me 2-hours to beat the first trial on Normal Mode. The length of the dungeon is perfect. After you complete the first trial, you unlock extras that will add 2 to 4-hours of extra gameplay (depending on your level of skill and chosen difficulty level), making a total of 4 to 6-hours of gameplay for Gladio's $5 DLC.

Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,PlayStation 4,Black Forest Games,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2015-08-19,"The original Giana Sister game was a blatant rip-off of Super Mario on the Commodore 64 that Nintendo strongly pressured the developers to stop selling.  Somehow the series survived and now we have the the latest game Giana Sisters: Dream Runners.  The game is unique take on 2D platformers that turned out to be a poorly executed terrible idea. The idea of Giana Sisters: Dream Runners is head-to-head speed running through a 2D platformer circular level.  You knock out a player by having them fall off screen or in the case of more than two players a 30 second timer starts when the first player is out.  The problem is that there is very little interaction between players so it feels like it doesn’t matter if you are on the same screen.  You can pick up power-ups but often they do very little and some are only designed to work when either in front or behind other players.  There is some level changing events that can be triggered but they still have very little impact on other players.  Often races between good players are never ending affairs of boredom. There are only 9 levels for you to have to memorize to become good but I am not sure who wants to invest their time mastering the boring levels for very little reward.  The controls are wonky, it is hard to see everything going on screen and difficult to keep track of your character.  This whole game seems like a throw away side minigame mode for a 2D platformer that doesn’t exist.  The developers have the gall to to charge $10 for very little content.  Visually it is just as  ugly and hard to look at as every Giana Sister game before it.  The only positive thing I can say about this game is that music is kick ass 80’s wankery which I quite enjoyed as an enthusiast of 80’s wankery music. There is online play with rankings but I couldn't find a single match while trying at different times of the day so you can add that to another reason not to buy this game. In summary, Giana Sisters: Dream Runners is terrible and I think maybe the world would have been better if Nintendo successfully sued this game series out of existence.",37,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,1.0,3.0,4.8,Generally unfavorable reviews,2.0,0.0,3.0,48.0

Hand of Fate 2,PlayStation 4,Defiant Development,"['Miscellaneous', 'Board / Card Game']",T,2017-11-07,"If there was one thing I heard people make fun of from elementary school to present day, it was people that played Dungeons and Dragons.  It was limited to the nerdiest of the nerds, where people would dress up and role-play as their character in this made up story. I’ve never had the opportunity to play a full on game of D&D;, but I’ve played plenty of board games and video games that were inspired by it. One of the biggest struggles in playing (in my experience, and partially why I never got to) was finding a Dungeon Master, and a party with a schedule that matched your own. So what if a video game could provide that piece for you? Hand of Fate 2 doesn’t exactly fill the role of DM, although it does something close. The game is played out based on the cards you select prior to starting each mission, which determines the encounters, equipment, characters, and spoils for your journey. The DM character then explains the situations, and you read each card’s situation as you go. If you are completely oblivious as to what you should be choosing for each level, you can have the game auto-select for you. But as the game points out, the AI is only so good when compared to an experienced player. It can mean choosing an encounter with great equipment as a reward opposed to a “freebie” card where you don’t lose anything, but don’t earn much else either. You’ll have card stats such as hit points and food that determine whether you live or die. Run out of food, and traversing the map will kill you unless you find more as each step damages you. Other stats like fame will allow you to wield equipment that required you meet a certain threshold. You’ll have gold for purchasing things such as healing, food, weapons and armor, as well as for the various encounters you run into during your travels. You never know when money will serve you better than your sword. Everything is easy to keep track of, as it’s always shown on the screen. Quite honestly, the card based part of this title is more fun than I expected. You’ll run into encounters where you’ll have to roll dice to succeed, use a pendulum to avoid combat, or choose the correct option in a dialogue tree. But the section you see throughout this review in the screenshots is the combat. This is a pretty large part of the game, albeit not always the best choice depending on the situation. Diplomacy is often not best executed on the battlefield. Combat is simple enough if you’ve played AAA action games in the past few years. In particular, it reminds me of Rocksteady’s latest series. You have a normal attack, a counter/defense button when you see green, and an evade button for when you see red. There is also a bash button to lower defenses if the enemy is covered in stone or has a shield up, for example. Earn enough hits without taking damage and you unlock the equipped weapon’s special ability, which can be merely a critical hit, or it can be something like an AoE attack. There will also be times when you’re prompted with a button to finish the enemy, and you get a neat little animation dependent on the weapon you you’re using. While the fighting works, it could definitely use something to make it stand out. I appreciate the different characters that you bring into battle, and the skills they offer against your own, but having more options in this mode would be nice. Something along the lines of Shin Megami Tensei‘s battles, where demons can give up or you can befriend them through a dialogue would really set this apart. The combat works, but adding something to make it a bit more unique compared to what other action games offer would really drive this game home. If you enjoy story based games mixed with action and lots of luck, this may be the perfect game for you. With a story you create yourself each time you play, mixing so many things people love about the physical board game with present day action games, it’s hard to not fall in love. Hand of Fate 2 is going to be overlooked by people because it’s card-based – don’t let that prevent you from trying this. There’s plenty to keep you coming back, and you never have to worry about anyone’s schedule to play it, other than your own.",82,Generally favorable reviews,12.0,2.0,0.0,7.7,Generally favorable reviews,11.0,0.0,3.0,77.0

Move on... with the occasional maze level and boss to fight…the combat is satisfying and fast enough, you have special attacks you unlock as your character levels up that you can use.. You can eventually bring a minion along to help in combat and heal you....but the gameplay sort of just feels there... there is no real challenge, intriguing levels... It all feels the same.  By itself it’s mediocre… there’s an infinite dungeon mode here which is about 15 times longer than a regular mission... where you can grind for levels and gear as its filled with enenmies and treasure rooms..But still the gameplay by itself is pretty bland.What makes this game actually good is its loot system and free to play system…Finally a free to play game that doesn’t shove micro transactions or gem buying down your throat...can you still buy those typical things of course... but the game does a great job of rewarding you just by playingthe game has something called happy jewels which you use to buy card packs which gives you 1 to 10 cards,.. You can buy happy jewels... the game seems to value a 10 pack at just under $20 which is a bit ridiculous to me, however I had no issue again earning these jewels by completing missions and challenges…and enemies and chests within these 5 to 10 minute long missions drop plenty of gear for you to equip to your character and even better is that if you get items you don’t want you can use them to level up your gear, even if those items are for a different character class using your happy stars which you get plenty of in these missions as well..This is where the hook is... this is where the fun is...it isn’t in the dungeons... it’s in going into these dungeons that are tied to the campaign, getting all of its gear and happy stars and dumping them into your favorite item to make them out until you find something better…you can even use your happy stars to buy cards as well, just without the guarantee of something decent like buying with happy jewels gives youThe dungeons again are pretty boring..But the loot system is guaranteed to get its hooks in youI give Happy Dungeonsa 7/10",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.5,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,2.0,2.0,45.0

And I loved using the katana on pretty much everything else.I easily had the most fun with the katana... but the fact that I had a favorite weapon for every enemy type tells you a lot about how much weapon variety actually matters in this game…That is such a refreshing feeling, where I feel like in most first person shooters I can get away with anything and it doesn’t matter… but here it doesunfortunately after you’ve played with all of the variants for a while, the game really starts to get boring and feels like it drags out way too long…Hard Resets biggest issue is hands down the level design…Every levels is activating switches while you kill everything between you and the switch…And every level really looks nearly identical…and honestly without having known that the game would be the same throughout, I was already unimpressed the moment the game started, as It looked like a dated bargain bin gameIts gray and boring, but there are some cool nail-biting sections towards the end of the game if you can manage to drag yourself through 7 hours of the same thing to get there…You practically see all there is to see in level 1, minus a few boss fights thrown in there…Hard Reset Redux offers a great deal of fun with its weapon variety,But if you don’t like feeling like you’re stuck in a demo level for 8 hours, you’re better off looking for your fun elsewhereI give Hard Reset Redux a6/10",69,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,9.0,2.0,3.0,73.0

Infinifactory,PlayStation 4,Zachtronics Industries,"['Puzzle', 'Action']",T,2015-12-22,"This is a great puzzle game. One of the top ones, that can take place among other gems like Portal, Talos Principle, etc. (even if it is little bit different) As you probably already know, this game is about building automated assembly lines. On one end you have a dispensers giving you material. On the other end you have a place where you need to deliver finished produts and teplate showing, what you need to create. Then you have a set of basic tools (conveyor belts, sensors, pistons, welding blocks,...) that you use to build the factory to achieve the goal. What I really like is that this game is easy to understand (there are just few simple blocks), but difficult to master (you can combine these simple tools in very sophisticated and creative ways). The game offers huge amount of content (so far I counted 55 puzzles and I believe I will still unlock few more). And they provide nice variety. Almost each level is little bit different. Not just because you are gradually unlocking new tools allowing you for new types of solutions. But even the puzzle design is different. Sometimes you get the blocks and you need to build something. Otherwise you may get finished product with defuct parts. You need to cut them off and replace with new ones. There are actually puzzles where you need to take one type of product and rebuild it into something else. And few other surprises. It is really nice, that each puzzle presents little bit different challenge. What I love about this game is its sandbox style. In this it is very different from other puzzle games. In usually puzzle games like Portal, Talos, Fish Fillets,... each puzzle usuaully has one solution. And you have to find it. Infinifactory is using completelly different approach. There are countless ways to solve each puzzle. When you first look at the puzzle, your head starts spinning with ideas - all of them valid. You have huge amount of freedom in this game. So this puzzle game is actually replayable. Because as you uncover new ways to deal with problems you will want to replay old level and find better solutions. This is also one of the very few puzzle games with working difficulty settins. For each puzzle you can increase input rate. Faster input means potentially faster solution. But it is also harder to build solution that will handle more components. Basically default setting and max setting represents completelly different puzzles that needs completelly differen solutions. So as I said - the replayability is huge. I would also have few complains. Especially about the controls. Constrols are not bad and you will be building without too much issues. But they are not perfects. And you will build wrong types of block, fight with select tool a little etc. (luckily there is undo button). It is not gamebreaking at all. But could be done a little bit better. Also some building rules are simplified. It is not exactly a bad thing (it makes building easier). But it limits your possibilities. One of such features is a rule that every block you place next to another block sticks together. So if you place something in front of the pusher (you want for example grinder block to be moved by the pusher), you can not place anything next to it. Otherwise it will be glued together and will not move. Or the power/signal line can not lead in paralel next to each other (the would connect automatically). And you need to have one empty block space between them. On one hand it makes building faster (you dont need to select direction of the signal line. It autoamtically connets to every attached block). On the other hand it limits how you can use the space. But overall it is awesome unique puzzle game. It totelly grabbed me and im having huge amount of fun. I definetelly recommend this to anybody who likes to tease their brain.",70,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's Quiz Time,PlayStation 4,Vision Games Publishing LTD,"['Miscellaneous', 'Trivia / Game Show']",E,2017-11-28,"There’s something that has captivated audiences for years on television – much like the gladiator battles in ancient Rome or jousting in medieval times, seeing a contestant win or lose is very exciting. Of course, we don’t often do things to the death anymore – even with fights in the UFC we have referees that stop a fight from becoming deadly. But going all the way back to the 1940s, we began to watch game shows – the first being a spelling bee. I saw plenty of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy as a child, and I’ve always enjoyed utilizing my useless knowledge of trivia, but I’m terrified of being in front of people. Cue the video game equivalent of a trivia game show. I’ve mentioned this before, but the Buzz! series started back in 2007 on the PS2, and while it wasn’t the first trivia video game to exist, it was potentially the biggest original IP in the genre. With its peripheral buzzers creating a sense of an actual game show environment, it was a welcome addition to the game space. Fast-forward a decade and we get It’s Quiz Time, a trivia game show with a computer host and well over 25k questions to be answered. Starting up the game, you have a few options to choose from. You can play by yourself, which entails answering 30 random questions. You’ll choose a specialty topic at the beginning, and for every one of those questions you’re asked, you get extra points awarded. Of course, if you answer wrong, you lose more points. In this mode, you’re penalized for each question you get wrong, and the longer you take to answer the question, the less points you will earn or lose. If you’re playing by yourself, don’t worry, there’s a leaderboard of people for you to compete with. But quite honestly, the game is meant to be played with others. Each match can hold up to 8 people locally, but if you choose to do a live show, you can compete against up to 10,000 other contestants. Naturally, this is best utilized by the likes of streamers, be it on YouTube, Twitch, or Mixer. All you need to play (other than a copy of the game) is a smart phone with the companion app, and you’ve got your “buzzer” so to speak. Much like the Jackbox Party Packs, you’ll be answering all the questions through this, so make sure you’ve got a good charge. If your phone dies, the game is nice enough to let your friends choose to wait, but if it’s just the two of you, saying no will end the game – no forfeiting allowed here. There are quite a few modes that change up how you’d play with the knowledge, including guesstimating dates or numbers pertaining to population, describing a topic and trying to match all the descriptors, or deciding if your friend will answer a trivia question right or not, and plenty more. In addition to a normal match that is randomly decided by Salli, you can create your own custom matches with however many modes you want to play, and choose which modes to play in particular if you don’t like certain ones. There’s also an event quiz which isn’t yet live. With every game show comes a host, and the host will often times make or break that show. Family Feud has likely never seen the number of viewers it does currently with Steve Harvey, and when you think of The Price is Right, do you really think of Drew, or do you think of Bob? There’s a lot of importance behind the voice of the show, and Salli is probably the weakest part of this game. With her robotic voice that seems to be used merely for pronouncing names, she feels very bland. Despite the fact that she said she’d never pronounce my name incorrectly after saying it like anyone would, she then said it in a way that I can only imagine a computer would think to say it. Her animations also don’t do her any favors, as they were often borderline creepy and looping. Salli aside, It’s Quiz Time is a party game anyone can get behind. With its questions based on your birthdate (optional, but makes the questions far more relevant), there’s trivia here everyone can have a fair shake at. Move out of the way Trivial Pursuit, there’s a new trivia game in town.",66,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth,PlayStation 4,Kalypso,"['Adventure', 'Visual Novel']",M,2017-09-12,"When it comes to life experiences, everyone has a different story to tell. Even if two people are placed in the exact same situation, their state of mind and previous life leading up to that moment will have an effect on how they view it. So when I had my wife start playing this for review purposes, I suddenly realized how big of a mistake it was watching the prologue and how it was unfolding. Admittedly, I’m unfamiliar with the original source material and the TV adaptation, so I was unsure of what to expect. The trailers seemed neat enough, and she certainly showed interest in it thinking it looked nice, but the opening is very powerful and it ruined her view of the game, so here I am reviewing it instead. Ken Follett’s The Pillars of the Earth Book 1 is the first part of a trilogy that Daedalic Entertainment has taken on – a 1,000 page novel turned to video game. A daunting task for sure, especially when you realize that story takes place in the 12th century and is focused on the creation of a cathedral. Something that dense with dialogue can undoubtedly not only be difficult to create, but doing so while being entertaining the whole way through may seem near impossible. As you may expect, there are some slow areas, and the lack of direction which is akin to older adventure games can make these parts drag on a bit. But in the end, it works surprisingly well. When first seeing footage from the game, I anticipated this to be a visual novel more than a game. Knowing the size of the source material, I had no idea that they’d not only make it something of an adventure game that they are known for at this point, but make it in such an expansive world. Yes, the game is linear in its story, as well as its overall direction (the choices you make don’t create too big of a difference in the end – at least in this entry), but it does a fantastic job of doing so in such expansive environments that are living due to the art. There are more than just a few “rooms” to explore in each one, and you’ll be revisiting them a lot as you attempt to progress the story. The art direction is a departure from the recent Silence, and not quite like their popular Deponia series, although it’s much more similar. The characters are drawn against hand-painted backgrounds, although the frames look like they’re on 4s or higher. Not a bad thing by any means, but people used to tweens will think the characters are wooden or poorly animated, when in fact it’s just not as many frames being used. For the record, Miyazaki Hayao animates on 4s, so it’s by no means something to be sneered at. Voice acting can struggle at times, although for the most part it’s very solid. The characters are given much more depth with the voiced dialogue, compared to being silent. Games like JRPGs I prefer no voices (thank you for the choice I Am Setsuna), but the actors in this bring a sense of weight necessary to the grim tale. In addition to dialogue wheels that you’ll be navigating as you have conversations with both side NPCs and main story characters, you’ll also be handling items. These will help with progressing the story, be it an event you are supposed to take part in, or a way to open up a new dialogue tree with someone. Almost in the way you do with the recent Sherlock Holmes games, you will also take acquired information and use that as a sort of item to progress the story and learn more from various NPCs. Over the course of this entry, you’ll take control of three different characters, which may seem separate at first, but with the arc of the story pertaining to the creation of a cathedral, it’s clear their paths will (and do) cross. Speaking of the cathedral, one of the scenes near the beginning of the game involves imagining what it will look like as you discuss it with your daughter. Each time you select what will be done next, the game changes the cathedral’s rendering – it’s a really beautiful scene, and much like how descriptors will paint a picture in your head while reading. It’s not often you see this type of world building, and it was really powerful. The adaptation is a dark adventure, and at times can be slow to play through – of course there are some light-hearted moments as well, which are much needed. With such an expansive narrative to convey, it’d be hard to get all the plot points across without having some downtime. And while “action” throughout seems like it’d be ideal in any story, the downtime is what allows you to appreciate the better parts. There were a couple of glitches visually that detracted from the experience, and some load times that didn’t seem necessary considering the rest of the game, but overall it’s a great start to what will likely be a great series. With two more entries on the way, likely matching the length of this one, you can expect around a 20 hour experience when it’s all said and done.",75,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,3.0,0.0,6.3,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,2.0,1.0,63.0

Kerbal Space Program: Enhanced Edition,PlayStation 4,BlitWorks,"['Simulation', 'Space', 'Combat']",E,2018-01-16,"This game is great. Only downsides are:1 - There are still few bugs. But hopefully these will be fixed soon.2 - It is really addictive and can eat a lot of your time. First small clarification what the ""enhanced edition"" is. The porting of this game was outsorced to another studio. It was released one and half year ago. In very broken and buggy state. It did not even passed certification on PS4 EU and due to savecorupting issues was basically unplayable. It appears the studio that did the port was not able to fix it. So new developer was hired to do a port again. And it was done basically from the scratch. So this ""enhanced edition"" is not patch to the original. It is completelly new port. (available for free for a customers of the original). It even appears as a separate game in your library. This is a reason why there are still some new bugs. From the development point of view this is basically new release. Not a patch. The ""enhanced edition"" in the name is only to separate the ports from each other. Now to the game itself:- Kerbal Space Program is a physics simulation game. You have huge selection of parts and you can build cars, rovers, planes, rockets from them and these vehicles behave according the weight, center of mass, motor placements, aerodynamics, thermodynamic, etc.... This is basically whole point of the game. There is no real story (but there are missions). What pushes you further is the need to prove yourself, that you can accomplish something bigger in this huge sandbox (whole solar system is available for you). Basic missions are simple, but there is always something more difficult availble. So you learn and progress slowly from baby steps to crazy rocket science. You start with just shooting small rocket into air and landing it by parachutes. Then you move to getting into orbit, visiting closest moon, docking spaceships, building satelites (later satelite network), landing on the moon and getting back, getting rovers (or even planes) to the other planets, building refuelling stations, mining asteroids, building huge spaceships from several pieces individually brought to space, building planet bases bases, etc. You get the idea. There are basically five modes to choose from:- Tutorial (not really a game mode, but they take lot of time and the latest ones and long guided missions, so I count them too)- Scenarios. These are standalone ""missions"". Basically the game puts you int some situation that would otherwise took you too long to reach in normal mode. So you can instantly drive rover on another planet or land the big spacecraft. Without spending hours to set up this situation yourself.- Sandbox. No explanation needed. You just have all options unlocked and you can build and fly anything you want.- Career. Here you need to manage funds, run science experiments, slowly unlock tech tree, hire and train pilots, upgrade buildings and run the missions. There are main missions that everybody gets in same order. And then many many random side missions. This is a mode most of the players will play. And you can spent ages in this mode.- Science mode. This is simplified career. You dont have to manage the whole space program. But you still need to unlock the tech tree by running science experiemnts in any way you like. So all in all. It is not a perfect game. There are still some bugs (hopefully fixed when you read this review). Not gamebreaking, but annonying. But slowly incriesing difficuilty in career mode will get you glued up to your screen. The game does not throw at you some insine mission from start. The next one is always just slightly more difficult then the previous one. And you just feel that you can do it. And the syndrom ""just one more mission"" can lead to long nights :-D",60,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Kingdom Hearts HD I.5 + II.5 Remix,PlayStation 4,Square Enix,"['Miscellaneous', 'Compilation']",E10+,2017-03-28,"Great value, especially if you're new to the world of Kingdom Hearts. The games haven't aged as well as I remember, and I'd all but forgotten about the frustrating camera, but generally they're still very entertaining. The sprinkle of Disney magic here is pretty unique in video gaming, and a lot of it will bring a broad smile to your face if you're a fan of either the classic or newer Disney movies. My previous experience of Kingdom Hearts was of only the first game and its numbered sequel on the PS2 - the other games included in the collection are handheld games which bridge the gaps of the occasionally convoluted plot (that's the Final Fantasy universe for you). At the price I paid (£33), you get 100+ hours of entertainment, remastered in HD. If you're a fan of Final Fantasy, or Disney - or especially if you're a fan of both - then you should give this a go. If, like me, you played the original games a decade ago, they are definitely worth revisiting.",84,Generally favorable reviews,34.0,1.0,0.0,8.5,Generally favorable reviews,150.0,11.0,21.0,85.0

I've downloaded games that I've known nothing about before, but I've never enjoyed one enough to create 4 lets plays as I did earlier today with Kitten Squad. When I downloaded the game I had no idea of PETA's involvement. Initially when I discovered this it was a turn off. Despite considering myself an animal lover I tend to disagree with PETA's tactics and I expected this game to be heavy with propaganda. But it's not. It's instead a top down game in the style of Binding of Isaac where cats save whales, dolphins, and other animals. The game offers a local co-op option and the selection of guns available allow for strategic play between you and your partner. Overall it's a free game, so you can't go wrong. It's a fun top down dual stick shooter that actually turns out to be surprisingly addictive. I will be going back to this.

Without giving away too much spoiler - I'd assume the game is a run down of the mental anguish the artist endures with each painting. Even if he captures a lost beauty in each painting he can not recreate anything as good as what he lost. Given what I found at the end in the kitchen, and the letter in the desk of the office, along with the items you collect throughout the game trying to recreate that beauty lost to a perfection. I assume he needed a sample of the original to attempt painting it from more than just memory. The story reminds me of Exmortis. Graphics similar to Silent Hill. Jump scares of Dead Space 2. And some scenes either FEAR 2 or Among the Sleep. Either way - This is the long awaited game I desired ever since Slender New Arrival was too short and easily completed with minimal effort. Great job overall.

Leaving Lyndow,PlayStation 4,Eastshade Studios LLC,"['Adventure', '3D', 'First-Person']",E,2017-07-27,"A girl prepares for the journey of her lifetime. She’s studied for years to finally graduate and join the Guild of Maritime Exploration, and now she must prepare for her trip and say goodbye to the life she’s known up until now. Have you ever been faced with a life changing event that made you visit all the people and places you hold near to your heart? If not, you’ll see what it’s like with Clara. Leaving Lyndow is the part of an RPG that you probably skip past when playing a full game to get to the “fun” portion of the game. If you’re not a fan of backstory or knowing why you’re playing a game, stay away from this, as that’s the entirety of the experience. This is a prologue to the studio’s upcoming game Eastshade, and is seemingly using the same engine and mechanics. That’s not to say this will have everything the full game will feature, but it’s a great way to dip your toes in to see if this will be up your alley. This is essentially a walking simulator, except there are people to interact with. There are a few games in the genre with NPCs, but it’s likely to save on time and money that they are often barren, as a lot goes into creating characters. The first person you’ll come into contact with is your mother, and it may make you question what type of species you are, as they certainly don’t appear to be human. This design aesthetic holds true with the rest of the characters you meet as well, and some of the walking animations may even make you laugh, whether they’re meant to or not. To be quite honest, it’s not made clear, but it’s not especially important to the game. It also seems to chug a bit with the frame rate, which makes moving around seem taxing on your eyes. On the other end of the spectrum for graphics, you have the environments, which are rich and lushly rendered. The focus outside of talking is clearly exploration, looking at all of the beautiful landscapes that you’ll be leaving behind. And as you are a painter in Eastshade, it makes sense that the world around you is gorgeous. While exploring, you’ll even have a vision – past or future, it’s not 100% clear, but certainly one of the more intriguing portions of the very short experience. In addition to exploring and speaking with people, there are collectibles and mini-games to play. Of course, they aren’t all mandatory for the game’s completion, but they do add more to the experience. Start to finish, you can 100% the game in about 30 minutes. Leaving Lyndow is a short experience, but one worth taking if you’re interested at all in their full length title that the devs have been working on since 2013. In addition to giving a taste of the game, it provides you with the backstory that will likely not be present in the full release. It may even leave you wondering what happens.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,2.0,4.5,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,3.0,1.0,45.0
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PlayStation 4,"Neon Studios, Kaiko","['Action Adventure', 'General']",E10+,2015-07-28,"Legend of Kay Anniversarybringing back the good and unfortunately the bad.Legend of Kay Anniversary is an HD remake of a PS2 game from 2005 and unfortunately this remake feels like nothing but a fresh coat of paint was added.Legend of Kay is a 3D platformer and pretty fun 3D platformer, there is so much to love about this game, its colorful, the characters have charm and levels are highly varied to prevent repetitiveness.You start the game out in a catvilliage to learn about these evil gorillas and rats trying to take over the land, so you train with your drunken sensei and you set out into the world to take these gorillas down.along your journey you’ll find crystals that boost your score to unlock collectibles such as concept art and weapon skins at the end of every level, you’ll find health upgrades, magic upgrades, and new armor and weapons.I really loved picking this world apart for its secrets and platforming my way through.You never know what the end of one level will take you or even where the middle of the level will take you, you could end up in a classic epic boss battle, riding a wild boar, in a swamp, a city, a cliff side,progression is so refreshingly unpredictableWhat isn’t refreshing though is the combatThe combat is very button mashy, not too many moves you can do, and enemies really take forever to kill,not only do they seem to be damage sponges, but they spam the block button like your little sister that doesn’t know how to play fighting games.This usually isn’t a problem if the battles are small, but most of the time you’ll be lucky to face less than 4 enemies at a time and while you’re trying to break their defense you’ll be getting cheap shotted from behind.I didn’t have too much trouble until about halfway through the game thoughthe difficulty spike was intense and hopping right in at nightmare difficulty from the start didn’t help either.There are some lifesaving pickups such as bombs and hornet nests you can find randomly or buy at a shop to bring into battle with you, and there are save shrines that revive your health and tons of extra lives around, but the health revival doesn’t even completely replenish your health and neither do the extra lives making them essentially useless.I’m not sure what the developers were thinking with the extra life systemI know you couldn’t defeat the spam blocking crocodiles with armor and full health, so were going to let you try again but this time starting with 25% of what you had to begin with.You’re better off backing out into the main menu and reloading your last save point rather than use an extra life.Speaking of head scratchers, this is 2015 and the game has camera controls from 2002they’re sticky and really give you no freedom, this can be insanely frustrating when you’re trying to slice through enemies or platform with the already stiff feeling controls that have plagued 3d platformers outside of Mario since forever.I felt like I died more times thanks to the camera than my own human error.It felt lazy to me that the developers wouldn’t go into the actual game and make it better, bring it up to today’s standards.I can’t imagine the team running around and saying wow, these camera angles are perfect, let’s not do anything to them, because honestly, they’re crap and out of all things, ruin this games overall experience the most.Despite the stiff controls, damage sponge enemies and crappy camera, I  still loved my time with Legend of Kay Anniversary and I believe you will too,I really wish the development team put more love into thoughThis game really had potential to reach the mid 8s to lower 9sFor What it is 3D Platformer: 8/10Overall:7.5/10",62,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,17.0,3.0,5.7,Mixed or average reviews,7.0,0.0,6.0,57.0

Just like in the original LiS, what appears out-of-context to be choppy dialogue (c'mon, folks; LiS had cheesy dialogue and, in some cases, not-excellent voice acting) actually melds together into believable conversations and satisfying narrative beats. There are cringe-worthy moments, but that's to be expected... and to be honest, some of them felt like intentional homages to the first game's ""charm"" (quality issues).",71,Mixed or average reviews,5.0,3.0,0.0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,85.0,8.0,19.0,79.0

Life is Strange: Episode 3 - Chaos Theory,PlayStation 4,DONTNOD Entertainment,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",M,2015-05-19,"The good: Astounding game that made me feel all sorts of emotions, I'm completely invested in the story and characters, and I would say that Dontnod does the formula better then telltale. Going off of telltale I have not experienced any immersion breaking graphical glitches (unlike telltale games where you will have body parts/ weapons fading through clothing etc) and the game tries to keep it so that the information you need to remember is provided within each episode (with one exception), which is handy since the business model has the episodes coming out every 2 or so months. The time travel mechanics are also very fresh (and thus unclear) and makes me wonder at the possibilities for time travel in future games. The bad: Some have pointed out issues with lip syncing but I have not noticed, also there is one exception to what I previously stated in that you do need to remember how the time travel mechanics work (which isn't very clear in the first place) from previous episodes, for example there were two puzzles in episode 3 which had me stumped for a good 10-15 minutes each, the first puzzle relies on using time travel mechanics in an unconventional way that you may or may not figure out as the game doesn't tell you (or if it does I don't remember it telling me which is a fault in clarity and guiding the player as several others have experienced this problem). The second puzzle I can't really get into without spoiling, but it was a failure in terms of game design, but not one that relies on the time travel mechanics. The ugly: Now for the business model, I abhor this business model (the episodic business model) and is one of the oldest tricks in the book in terms of television, it makes you want the next episode encourages you constantly thinking about it throughout the weekly, month;y or yearly, release schedule. This is a common marketing ploy used to keep you thinking about a product and is very effective in making you want more. However I am still willing to give this game a 10, which I suppose speaks to its effectiveness. TL:DNR Great game, while not a ""game changer"", like games such as Telltales the Walking Dead, it is still one of the finest examples of the genre and of storytelling in video games.",81,Generally favorable reviews,28.0,5.0,0.0,8.2,Generally favorable reviews,170.0,22.0,23.0,82.0

Other activists are next on the list – and it’s up to Lincoln and Roxy Laveau (daughter of Charles “The Voice” Laveau) to get to the bottom of what’s happening.

It’s a place where some folks tried to preserve a narrow-minded way of life.  Minorities weren’t welcome, especially after dark. “Just like the main game, we wanted to capture a snapshot of a specific time and place in American history, and let the player experience it.” Since Sinclair Parish is a small rural township in the countryside near the Bayou, expect lots of opportunities to tear through turns, jump gaps and run from the law.

You have to control Samual's breathing, blinking, movement, etc. Through out the game, it changes a bit, but doesn't bring anything new. The final battle isn't meant for these controls, making it super frustrating, less then fun. Controls don't respond sometimes as well. The story is a guy named Samual who died, and went to hell.

Masquerade: The Baubles of Doom,PlayStation 4,Big Ant Studios,"['Action', 'General']",T,2016-04-19,"I freaking LOVE this game, and there are a ton of reasons why. The combat is awesome if you can get the hang of it, which is more like a jackie chan movie type movement as opposed to like a Dynasty Warriors style where you just swing away and enemies fall.  Countering an enemy's attack is made easy by an indicator by their heads showing when you can counter.  Visuals are awesome. Think Battleborn or Gigantic but more cartoony.  The humor is goof ball, stupid humor, but it's funny and appreciated.  There is a kill cam like in Syrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4, which is awesome.  Your character is a jester and while most of his combat is normal, he does have one part of his combo sometimes where he jumps into the air and slams the enemy in the face with his butt.  You add to this a slow motion kill cam and the edge of a cliff, and the result is hilarious satisfying game play.  Enemy minions often spawn from outhouses and literally come out of the hole where the poop goes, ya know, like, porta potties from 100 years ago? lol Which is goofy, but then when you repeatedly see the same minions taking a crap into one of those outhouses, into the same hole that you see them pop out of, that was pretty freakin entertaining when I realized that.

MechRunner,PlayStation 4,Spark Plug Games,"['Action', 'General']",E10+,2017-04-18,"This week when the PlayStation Store updated a game that has been out on the PlayStation Vita, as well as other platforms, made its debut on the PlayStation 4. MechRunner by Spark Plug Games is a game where the player controls a Mech which made me immediately think of Transformers, simply because of how the mech quickly changes from Standing upright like a Human to its Tank Vehicle form just like many of the mechs in Transformers. The player is viewing the mech in a 3rd Person pulled back sort of view, and the main concept of the game is for the player to control the Mech as it makes its way down twisting and turning city street, while dipping and dodging in an attempt to avoid smashing into any of the many obstacles in the way. Some of these obstructions you come in contact with are vehicles, broken buildings, and other materials including parts from the Enemy Mechs that constantly pop up in front of you while you are traveling down the street which prompts a quick shootout battle. If you succeed in these quick battles with the different kinds of enemy mechs you continue down the street. MechRunner is not an easy game by any means, at times I found myself becoming very frustrated but at that same time I was having fun and I enjoyed the challenge. For most of my first time playing the game it seemed like the game only had one stage and it was a sort of endless runner sort of game where the environment barely ever changed if at all but I learned after viewing some of the unlocks that you actually have to earn currency to unlock the remaining three stages which seem to be pretty expensive, judging by how long it takes to earn said currency. There are other upgrades and unlocks to help you on your journey but like the stages, these also seemed a bit expensive. In my opinion overall there is not much involved in this game, there are not any difficult mechanics to understand or mind blowing story plot twists but what you will find in MechRunner is a challenging, frustrating, but decently fun Game that I see PlayStation Trophy hunters heads spinning while trying to obtain all MechRunners elusive trophies..",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

I haven't even tried that mode yet, just single player mode... object of the game? collect stated amount of coins before given time ends, trying not to get hit by anything (ala mario) and also trying to collect said amount of coins in one go (although you can bank the coins you already have so when hit by an enemy, your coins won't be expelled from your body ala sonic the hedgehog).. the difference? you can dash in any direction to kill enemies and to destroy blocks or you could also resort to one of the many weapons or powerups.. to challenge myself, I'm going exclusively for the 3 stars in each level (perfection).  easy at first but quickly gets very challenging... simple controls and constantly changing levels make it fun.  levels are broken down into several ""sets"", which contain blocks, coins, powerups, enemies etc, which will disappear and change after some time.. usually a level will have several ""sets"" which randomly alternate, so you'll eventually learn how to beat each set increasing quantity of enemies, higher coin objectives and the occasional control mishap (sometimes you want to dash again after dashing and sometimes it doesn't work, or sometimes the controls are a little too sensitive, or the other way around, sometimes it feels like it didn't respond fast enough) make it sort of a rage fest if you're going for the three stars, but ya know what, it's so much fun you'll keep coming back for more, pressing retry for just one more go.  The control issues are mostly because you need to keep on your feet with fast reflexes, trying to do everything at once or failing to time correctly, but dying almost always feels like ones own fault rather than the game's, so you don't feel cheated when death comes.  the upgrades on your moves, weapons and abilities after collecting a star add to the experience and the variety of characters seem interesting..  great little gem of a game, even when yet to try local multiplayer (no online, but personally I don't care for that)",0,No score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Minecraft: Story Mode - A Telltale Games Series - The Complete Adventure,PlayStation 4,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",E10+,2016-10-25,"I've always enjoyed TellTale's interactive story-telling; from The Walking Dead to the Wolf Among Us.  Although great games they can sometimes be stressful to play as you feel lots of your decisions could have dire consequences.  In Minecraft: Story Mode your choices are still important but overall its a much more relaxing experience.  Most of the choices in the dialog either involve choosing how nice/mean you'll be or taking sides between your allies and various perceived enemies.  The choices might have some impact but really its mostly just a chance to take part in what is really a very linear experience.  Linear or otherwise this is a wonderful experience for both Minecraft fans or anyone who enjoys inactive narratives. The story focuses on Jesse (you) along with his friends and pet pig on a mission to save the world from a giant Wither storm.  It all starts after a deal goes bad and you chase the antagonist into his lab.  He has a grudge against The Order of the Stone, a famous group of heroes worshiped by fans for their adventures and achievements.  After things get out of control it will be up to you to get The Order back together to come up with a plan to defeat the growing threat.  However you quickly realize the The Order didn't break up on good terms and it will fall more or you and your friends to pick up the slack and convince them to cooperate. This all leads up to quite a grand adventure.  You'll start at the festival Endcon and quickly retreat to the Nether.  From there you'll have to investigate the different homes of various members of The Order.  This will lead you to travel places like The End and The Far Lands.  The characters all have vibrant and unique personalities.  Although there are plenty of intense serious moments there is plenty of humor present too.  The writing is very clever and excellent voice actors really bring the characters to life.  The Minecraft references are plenty and are quite a treat for those really familiar with the game. Story Mode is an apt title since the focus is clearly on narrative over gameplay.  This definitely feels more like a movie with interactive cut-scenes than a traditional videogame.  This being said the interaction available is quite enjoyable.  The main interaction you'll gets is through the your dialog choices.  Its not much but those choices really help keep you immersed.  Other then the dialog there are quite a few exciting quick-time events during the action sequences.  The last element of the gameplay are the opportunities to check-in with your allies during slower moments.  These scenes will usually involve walking around to find or interact with certain items to advance the story. On thing I find really interesting about Story Mode is how many of the antagonists aren't necessarily bad guys.  Its really interesting how this game makes you look at different circumstances and how they lead the characters to their present states.  Each episode is a solid hour and a half long and with eight episodes available in the deluxe edition this game will keep you busy for a while.  The last couple levels (available in the complete edition or  as downloadable content) are all unique adventures digging deeper in to different aspects of Minecraft from YouTubers to popular multiplayer mini-games.  This is a wonderfully balanced narrative with plenty of exciting and funny moments.  Make sure you check this one out, especially if you're a fan of Minecraft or other Telltale games.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.6,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,2.0,3.0,66.0

Minecraft: Story Mode Season Two - Episode 3: Jailhouse Block,PlayStation 4,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",E10+,2017-09-19,"Minecraft Story Mode: Season 2 Episode 3 delivers yet another thrilling and engaging storyline along with some action packed themes and impactful story changing decisions different to what we got in Episode 2 along with some dark themed dynamics tailored towards the story. I was exceptionally impressed with Episode 2 with its fast paced action and gameplay and not to mention the plot twist at the end, leaving me in one of the biggest cliff-hangers in this entire franchise. Fortunately Episode 3 does an amazing job at continuing from all of the drama and continuing right where the end of the previous episode left Jesse and his friends and I am not disappointed by it. The writing done to this plot really works and really pays off. Our friend Jesse is sent to a deep, hidden underground prison/reformatory (hence the title of this episode; 'Jailhouse Block') after angering the mentally deranged admin for apparently not showing him as his 'champion' in the previous episode. We are once again reunited with most of the characters featured in the last episode (including the admin during the middle of the episode). The great thing about this is that the first character we are reunited with is determined out of the two characters (Jack or Petra) that was selected during the end of the last episode while deciding on who would go for the clock being the main goal of the episodes plot. This means that depending on who you selected, the beginning of this new episode will be slightly different, though no matter who it is, you will be introduced with an awesome, action packed intro featuring some point and click gameplay just like in Episode 3 of the first season. As well as that, we also get to see a couple of new characters in this episode such as the quirky Warden. We are even reintroduced with a couple of other characters previously seen such as Jesse's friend and assistant Radar, and Nurm the Villager. In the last episode, I had noticed a favourable bond between Jesse and Radar who I had also grown a bond too. During the beginning of this episode however, he is the victim of the episode first major decision which the Warden uses him to influence you into working for him or resisting. During my two play throughs of this episode in choosing both options, I noticed that some of these have very little change to the story while the others have a more impactful change to the storyline. One of these choices made near the end of the episode ends up being not only once of the hardest decisions to make in this entire series, but once of the most heartbreaking. Of course since this episode is set in a dreadful prison, the plot follows Jesse and his friends trying to escape, where they discover that there is one particular prisoner who is the only one who knows the escape route. Referred to as 'Prisoner X', Jesse and his friends must find a way to get to her heavily fortified and guarded cell deep in the prison. based off the choice you made from deciding to work for the Warden or refuse, you will depend on your experience to how you will get yourself to the bottom floor known as the 'Zombie Mines' consisting of all the poor and disgusting prisoners forced to kill and eat zombies. If you decide to work for the Warden, you will promote yourself to working in the room, while if you refuse to, you will find a way to deliberately get yourself into trouble. Once Jesse encounters Prisoner X, Jesse is forced to leave behind one of the series companions; Nurm the Villager and Jacks best frined, or Lluna the Llama the series new animal companion. This choice was both hard and sad to decide because although we hadn't seen these characters that much, what we had seen were strong. Speaking of Stella, we get to see her again where this time she works as an associate and of course has the same bitter & ruthless attitude towards Jesse along with her 'rival' vibe. Some point in the episode, we have the option to let her join us from reasoning with her. if you choose this, than she promises to 'have your back' hopefully in a future episode. And yet again in this episode we are introduced to another cliff hanger though this time it starts during the beginning of the second half of the episode where the admin makes an appearance at the prison bringing back your friend that you chose to retrieve the clock in the previous episode where he tries to force the two of you to fight. After a failed attempt at striking the admin himself, he takes his evil tactics beyond all measures by manipulating Jesse's identity and threatening Beacontown and his older friends. And yet this was all happening when Jesse still has a prison to escape, and once he had, the ending lead to a second cliff hanger!In conclusion, this episode has proven that this season just gets better and better and is the best in the series thanks to all the action, impactful and versatile decisions and consistent cliffhangers which has once again left me very excited for what is to come next.",63,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,0.0,5.2,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,0.0,3.0,52.0
Minecraft: Story Mode Season Two - Episode 4: Below the Bedrock,PlayStation 4,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",E10+,2017-11-07,"Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 Episode 4 continues this series at a fairly strong pace along with a lot of new factors that both impressed me and disappointed me. Firstly lets start with the setting. As the title suggests 'Below the Bedrock', Jesse and his friends, have just escaped the Sunshine Institute where there only escape route is to venture even deeper underground beneath the bedrock to which we all thought was a vast world or darkness and emptiness. This episode has made us believe that the world of Minecraft Story Mode features an entirely different and forgotten world underneath the Bedrock where the Admin (Romeo) is the one responsible for concealing it and forcing everyone to believe that its empty. This setting like the Sunshine Institute does not stay subtle with the dark themes and yet adds some spookiness right at the start. Yet again we are introduced to a unique nightmarish mob; a giant Enderman. This mob made me feel as if it is there to not only try and kill us but also to annoy us as seen when we encounter it the second time. In the previous episode we met a character initially referred to as 'Prisoner X' and named Xara, where she is revealed to be a former Admin being the reason to why she seemed to know a lot about Romeo the real Admin and the escape route of the prison. While at first a very eerie character who was very reluctant on meeting Jesse, it seems that now all of a sudden she now thoroughly trusts us. Maybe this is just because of her previous personality before being imprisoned and having her friend and former admin Fred killed and still remains distraught but I cannot help thinking of this two-faced personality that Telltale abruptly created. The episode clearly shows her 'aggresive' emotions towards the loss of Fred but does it feel like we're friends all of a sudden? However during my two playthroughs of this episode where I made the opposite choices in the previous episodes as well as this one, I noticed that depending on one of the choices you make in regards to Xara she will either help you fight the mobs who try to impede your escape along with the giant enderman or she will ditch you like Jesse did before. To think that that final choice was completely useless, I guess not. Other new things that was featured in this episode included a trivia test. This is something I have always wanted since my first Telltale game (the Wolf Among Us) because despite being completely irrelevant to the storyline of most games, is something I always fabricated based off the 4 choice point and click style dialogue choices referencing the choice answers or a multiple-choice question. I was happy to see it in this episode but disappointed by the fairly lazy and indifferent way it was implemented into the game. This was a test based of supposed facts about Fred, the fallen leader of the community we were tasked to venture to and the former third Admin. In my first playthrough I did like how you need to free roam the town to learn and study some 'Fred facts' and thought that you need to do this to win the test and progress through the game where other free roam events in previous episodes you can just bypass. During my second playthrough I found out that I was wrong. Whether you pass the test or not, you still progress through the story in finding the weapon to defeating Romeo making the free roaming once again useless to the story. Or you could just wing the test as you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting the question right due to the dialogue choices given to you. How does Jesse even know these without even been given the options. Thankfully the trivia also featured a building contest through the newly introduced building mechanic which was a nice way to implement it into the episode and a lot better than that of the previous episode, but even with that whether you build from absolutely nothing to the coolest thing in the world, the round will end in a draw. So if you spend 2 hours on the episode just on the build, than that's just a waste of time. This episode actually managed to add a second build later on in the episode when you reach the town 'Romeosburg' which again is useless and not worth noting. What is worth noting however is the boss battle we get to do. In the last episode we were able to fight a unique creation of a ghast 'a three headed ghast', this time it was a giant magma golem. Not only was this an awesome design but a really cool and detailed way of defeating it involving water, mining and explosions (just see for yourself, you won't be disappointed). And yet again we are encountered with another battle with the giant enderman just before escaping via a portal and another difficult choice mainly involving which character(s) you will be with in the next episode. Overall, while not the most impressive entry in the series it still managed to keep me intrigued to the story and excited for what is to be a big and thrilling ending to this series.

That’s exactly what the original was like, so it’s a plus in my opinion. I like having to earn my fun. I’ve read complaints that it’s really challenging to win races on the highest difficulty.

Once again, it’s exactly like the original which only had races and time trials. The reviewers will tell you to stay away if you were a fan of the originals, but it appears many of the reviewers either never played the original or they have bad memories. There are the hallmarks of MR1 all over this title, it’s like a remake for the current generation. My only issues are that the graphics aren’t great for a 4th gen console, and that your peripheral vision is cut down in split screen mode making it hard to navigate through tight corners that you can’t see around.

MotoGP 17,PlayStation 4,"Koch Media, Milestone S.r.l","['Racing', 'Arcade', 'Automobile']",E,2017-07-11,"Still too much bugs.. 1. soundtrack wont play when you enter career mode. 2. Exactly the time When you finish the race a.k.a cross the finish line, then everybody also 'finish' their race by slowing down, celebrating, etc. so they're not push and race till finish line anymore. for example, if you have a 5s gap to the second place while in the last sector of last lap, and then when you cross the finish line, the second place (and the other riders) imidiately celebrating even still in the last corner. Therefore, in the results tab, you win by 8s margin.. wtf.. 3. When you finish behind a rider with a very little gap (about 0.070s or less), you still win the battle in the end. It turns up you finish 'ahead' of him by 0.001s or even less (could be exactly 0.000s). When i recheck and freeze the replay video in the finish line, i'm sure that i lost the battle because actually my opponent cross the finish line CLEARLY ahead of me, and by some MARGIN TOO (maybe about 0.07s) 4. Still continuing from 3rd point, when that happens, it screwed the point system and podium celebration. You can be finish ahead in the timesheet (for example battling for third place - the podium!), but you still didn't get the podium celebration. So wierd. And the point? I dunno.. because in some point i realized that the opponent sometimes did not get the right points too.. so you race the championship for nothing.. 5. There still some extended hairpin that when you touch it, it feels like in gravel. Although it is an ""asphalt"".. 6. This one is one of the most silly feature that motogp 17 has.. when you touch someone's bike from behind, or his sides, you both became slow down, it's like halted. Even when in the straight line, you touch someone's rear end, you both became slow and overtaken by others.. the worst part is.. when YOU being touched from behind (which is pretty often in simulation mode - another silly AI behaviour), then you also slowed down.. wtf is this crap. 7. When you have a chance to seal the world title if you finish the last race at least (for example) 3rd position, the race target did not follow that chance.. the team still telling you that finish in 10th position is the target.. what a motivation! 8. After you seal the world title in the last race of the season, no confirmation even for who is the world champion with how many points, etc.. and worse, you did not get the ""congratulations!"" thing.. it's like nothing happen.. and carry on.. like: ""for the next season, which team you want to? Stay in your current team? Stay in moto3 class (even in the real world, regulations said that a moto3 world champion MUST step up into moto2 class) Step up to moto2 class? Or even demote to redbull rookies cup?"" WTH...Even in the email section there is no review of your season, congratulations for sealing the world champion, farewell email from your old team, welcome email from new team, etc.. it's like we're in the stone age that dont use email.. 9. How can milestone remove the sighting lap every time you go out from garage?? 10. In some circuit, the AI's racing line still messed up. 11. You'll struggle to achieve a good result in qualifying - that's good. But in the race they're slow as f*ck.. they can't even match my slowed race pace.. with low class team i still can win the race easy.. 12. AI too stupid. They will ALWAYS pass a rider by late braking, no matter what even they will go wide by doing so. It worsening when i want to hit a corner then suddenly got hit from the inside (even i already close the room in the inside) they still come thru using grass - and then getting me wide, and because we touched, we slowed.. wtf is that?? 13. Still about AI's stupidity. In the straight when there's a CLEAR and EASY chance to pass me, sometimes, they BRAKING INSTEAD! Although i only accidentally block them a bit! They won't take the other line and choose to brake.. 14. Others that need improvement: braking power still too much. In real world a moto3 bike need to brake at about  4-5 seconds, way before entering the first corner in Qatar circuit. But in this game you can brake really close to the corner and brake about 2-3 seconds. Other than that, i like this game because it's the only official game that motogp has..",68,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,14.0,1.0,2.5,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,1.0,3.0,25.0

Además cada coche cuenta con una habilidad especial única y un arma ligera y pesada que se puede elegir al comenzar la carrera. En definitiva es un juego muy divertido, se lo recomiendo a la gente a la que le guste la diversión.

Mount & Blade: Warband,PlayStation 4,"Koch Media, Taleworlds","['Role-Playing', 'Western-Style']",T,2016-09-13,"With the last of my PSN credit, i saw this on sale for £7.99.  i watched a review on youtube, from a very obese geeky looking man expressing a deep love for Mount & Blade on the PS4.This has been the most unexpected delight of my festive season purchases. I have been averaging 5 hours a day in one of the most challenging unique campaigns of any game, ever.Warband is in effect a sandbox realm of some 20 cities, dozens of castles and all with villages. Trade, fraction wars, deception, betrayal, crime pillaging and kidnapping, all happens all the time.To start, expect a grind. You start off as a nobody, free to wonder, but vunerable to looters and bandits on the roads. There is no right way of playing Warband. You can aim to be the hand of a king, who will lead other nobles under the fraction to besiege enemy castles or towns. Then, you may be chosen as lord of that castle etc. Earning rent to fund a larger army, or businesses in towns. Or, you could work as a mercenery for a kingdom, battling for a weekly wage. Or you could master coin and just make endless cash trading and questing for towns and villages.But the option i tend to sway to is to become a king and crush all the other fractions.My current play through, i am some 1000 days in. Ive 9 cities and some very powerful lords under me. I own businesses in all the towns in the realm and im at peace with all other fractions. Its taken years to gain the Right To Rule, so that other kings no longer see me as a warlord. I have a high honour rating and some 5k elite troops amongst my towns to defend. It doesnt sound a lot, but its a constant challenge dealing with the egos of the nobles beneath me, and here lies the genius in warlord. Its about managing nobles and ensuring you have as little betrayal as possible. This open ended gameplay and relationships i can really control makes this an endless stategic minefield. Battles are chaos. You will get odd glitches, but they tend to favour you. Such as enemies running into trees on horseback and taking a little time to wedge out. I found it essential to get a good mount and armour early on, as keeping mounted in battle makes it a hell of a lot easier to keep alive. Once levelled to 20 or so, your character should be strong enough to take on a group whilst mounted. It becomes a block and slash game. The graphics are very weak for ps4, but the 100 troop battles rarely have much FR drops and whilst somewhat last decade now, its still satisfying to be at the top of a ladder slashing at enemies, getting splattered red in their blood. The sounds are sometimes very satisfying when you charge an enemy mounted and slash their.throat on passing. Its not probably gory enough, but its addictive.The depth of mechanics going on all the time is really something unlike any other ps4 title, be it a caravan being raided meaning raw materials have increased in price, impacting your profits, or, be it you letting a defeated lord go free after battle gaining his favour and honour, or be it recruiting a companion you can level up how you like, the game keeps you endlessly on your toes. The grind is from the off to build reputation, but once youve got enough you can do as you please.Ive introduced Warband to a number of gamer-mates, non of whom have looked at all interested. This is a very solititude experience and not a game to watch someone grind through. Its always rewarding. Sometimes i would spend 60 days in game raising elite troops and befriending villages nearby a town i was plotting to.attack to help wirh enlisting new troops if i was successful in my attack and had to defend the inevitable strike back. Some of the most entertaining battles in game were being 230 men vs an epic 1300 or so. But on the walls, tactics and grouping makes a huge difference and even on harder game settings can be won. I wont lie though, warband is hard. Even on the easiest setting, auto saves mean you must expect to occassionally be captured by the enemy. Those troops you raised from bandits, dead. Having towns or castles helps tackle this loss by allowimg you to put whatever troops you like in there, at a cost.Overall, ive played about 10 years in game between a few play throughs. Taken 100+ hours and find myself dipping back into it over a number of AAA titles. I couldnt recomend this enough if youre a fan of sandbox games with huge freedom, this is still a bargain even at full price £29.99",67,Mixed or average reviews,5.0,12.0,1.0,7.5,Generally favorable reviews,17.0,1.0,4.0,75.0
MouseCraft,PlayStation 4,Crunching Koalas,"['Miscellaneous', 'Puzzle', 'Action', 'General']",E,2014-07-08,"Mousecraft is a surprisingly delightful and challenging puzzle game that is hindered by its somewhat drab graphics and ability to complete levels without getting a perfect score. But despite its shortcomings, Mousecraft hits its gameplay spot on, featuring a very good (if not a tad aggressive) difficulty progression, thoughtfully developed levels, and novel elements that keep puzzles fresh and entertaining during gameplay progression. In Mousecraft, you control the composition of a level, by placing or destroying blocks, in order to get three mice from a starting point to the goal. Both the ability to place items in levels or destroy items is limited making often requiring extremely precise choices to complete a level with a perfect score. If the game had one major flaw it would be that levels can be completed without collecting all items and getting all mice to the goal. While this may have been a mechanism to allow the gamer to choose their own difficulty, completing a level with less than perfect is often very unsatisfying, allowing the gamer to progress quickly through levels thus robbing the gamer of the feeling of satisfaction having bested a challenging puzzle, making further progression a daunting endeavor. The second flaw is less important, though may be responsible for the games tepid reception -- the graphics. The game is drab and the characters uninspired. Mousecraft may have gotten much higher scores had it featured characters like Super Mario's Toad with a ""Super Mario 3D World"" aesthetic -- staunchly implying that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the game; it is very fun, challenging, and well-designed. But superficially it is easy to pre-judge and hence approach the title with a negative bias. I urge those that enjoy light puzzles to approach Mousecraft with an open mind and to complete each level with a perfect score before progressing. You may find it to be very fun and satisfying, and may ultimately determine that the game is criticized incommensurately with its shortcomings.",72,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,6.0,0.0,5.6,Mixed or average reviews,13.0,19.0,14.0,56.0

I will be covering the hopefully in detail. Single Player: Single Race: Pick between 5 modes and play tracks you have unlocked for those modes. There are around 35 ish tracks which is a big improvement over last years game, which only had 17. Career: A total of 18 series spanning the race and rhythm racing game modes. It should take you around 15 hours to complete. Multiplayer: Local Multiplayer: Basically, it's single race mode, but in split screen (2 players only). Online: HOLY **** THIS MODE IS BROKEN! the only time I managed to join a server, I was met with lag and glitches. But hey, it is at least more balanced than the 360/ps3 versions. Race modes: Nationals: Race in 12 tracks ripped straight from Alive. they are still fun, even though there are framerate issues on them. Free Ride: Race on all of the tracks in the game (except for nationals tracks) they are open world and you are free to explore them. Great for practicing the tracks. Supercross: The main meat of the game. 17 tracks most of which are well designed. Waypoint: 4 Open world tracks that let you take your own route to each waypoint. Fun but short mode. Rhythm Racing: 5 straight tracks where the only focus is to find the fastest rhythm to the finish. Pros:-Great and improved physics.-Fun track design-Lots of variety-Lots of content-Great customization Cons:-Bad framerate sometimes-Glitchy  online multiplayer-Sometimes questionable glitches. Most of my problems come from the game's technical issues which, hopefully can be fixed in a patch.

You are given a single screen with the goal in plain view and its down to you to navigate the landscape while avoiding the enemies that inhabit this world using nothing more than a jump button and the movement keys. And while I feel that the vast vast majority of people will never fully 'complete' this game, there is still more than enough content at an assessable, more casual level that anyone with an interest in platformers will get their $20 dollars worth out of. Personally speaking, at the time of this writing I have over 40 hours invested into this game and I'm still no where near full completion of this game. The only downside to this game is a lack of online multiplayer (couch only) which is honestly not a huge deal given that as this game is a game that relies on precision, I could only imagine that even the smallest amounts of lag on the best network connections available in this world would still render this game a frustrating experience. If you can get a friend together in the same house the multiplayer stuff that is there just adds to the already extraordinary amount of content that there is. Are there better platformers available? Possibly, depending on your tastes. But if you are looking for a game that strips away the genre to its bare essentials I find it difficult to imagine there will ever be a game better at that then N++.",82,Generally favorable reviews,43.0,4.0,0.0,6.5,Mixed or average reviews,42.0,3.0,20.0,65.0

Natural Doctrine,PlayStation 4,Kadokawa,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'General', 'Fantasy', 'Tactics']",M,2014-09-30,"A game that gives you tools to annihilate enemies with impunity, but also gives them that chance. If you make the mistake and let them. Natural Doctrine is a very hard, but also a very fair game in that everytime you fail, it's been your own fault. Very little in the game is left up to chance and number differences, and whether you fail or succeed depends on how you wield the tools the game gives you. If you're sloppy in pulling up the rear of your group; if you advance too aggressively; if you try to win by turtling; if you fail to multiply your forces by activating links; if you waste all your force by activating all your links early; if you fail to check the sight lines of your gunners: You get punished. But everytime it's because you made a mistake that you can learn to avoid the next time. Now, this admittedly may not be entertaining for everyone. Some people prefer a good cinematic CoD session, some people prefer a cartoony evening with Rayman, some people prefer the well-told story of adventures like Monkey Island. This game is squarely aimed at people who wish to stress their brain. It suffers from only two things, which are minor: It loves to play all its animations, however this can be improved by holding circle all the time to speed them up. It does not do a good job explaining the game mechanics, because the translation team itself did not understand them; this is not much of an issue though. It has a fairly gentle curve in how it lets you learn and come to grips with the mechanics, and offers free dungeons the player can repeat as often as they like, and offers checkpoints in the dungeons. I might see this differently, because i'm german, but the story is refreshingly earnest and pragmatic. At one point the main character suffers a traumatic loss, which in most other games would make him the depressed and disturbed hero for the rest of the game, who rests all the blame on one bad person. In this game the main character manages to realize that the group as a whole failed, and that despite what happened, they need to keep moving or die. Also, to adress one popular negative argument trotted out against the game: The door with tens of goblins behind it all ready to slaughter you. This is a perfect example of how every failure is the player's fault. There is a number of such doors in the game, and for everyone a simple rule is in effect that is explained the first time you encounter a door: As long as the character opening it is not the last character you can move in the current turn, your next character will have initiative after opening it, enabling them to use links to activate the rest of the team and slaughter whatever's beyond the door. Natural Doctrine is brave enough to offer refreshingly unique and challenging gameplay, and is unfairly panned by people who simply did not understand one of its simplest rules.",53,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,18.0,10.0,5.9,Mixed or average reviews,41.0,9.0,35.0,59.0

This, for Me, makes this My ATF (All-Time Fav) hoops game, & on the PS4 it's just absolutely gorgeous. The only gripe for true purists will be the over-the-top WWEish MyCareer mode which includes cheesy cut-scenes & the innately annoying knack for your counterpart to always be catching fire & carrying his team to an unrealistic degree. Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting ""ON FIRE!!"", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews. The online is a different twist on park hoops which allows you to watch & join games going on live by calling ""next"".

Looking past that veneer, however, is a Synthwave/Retrowave soundtrack and eclectic and edgy 1980s-meets-postmodern art style that I've never seen a game capture as well as Neon Drive.  The music is indeed exceptional, and the visuals are indeed stunning. Where the game falls apart, however, is not even in its' length (only 8 songs with 3 difficulties, but still more providing more mileage than you might expect compared to games with the usual Rock Band-sized playlists), but in its' accessibility.  In this regard, the major issue can be summed up in one word: checkpoints.  While many hardcore rhythm game players have taken issue with the game's higher difficulties being perhaps too easy in comparison to games like Audiosurf, the base normal difficulty may not be the most difficult thing in the world, but you are only allowed one mistake on said difficulty, and there are only two or three checkpoints littered throughout a song.  While this would seem forgiving, it's important to note that this means that even at the lowest levels of play, Neon Drive is a game that expects 100% accuracy not as an achievement, but as the minimum passing standard.  So in this way, Neon Drive kind of comes off as a game that's too casual for hardcores, yet too hardcore for casuals. Barring that, however, I would say it could have absolutely broken into my top 5 rhythm games of all time due to its' presentation alone.  The fact that the gameplay is addictive in true Audiosurf form is only the icing on the cake.  If the developers were a little more intuitive with the adjustment of lower and higher difficulties, I'd say it's a perfect rhythm game for one so short.  But this is an issue of balancing that's worth noting, even if only in passing.  But if you're somebody who enjoys the occasional challenge of rhythm games without feeling like you have to play with the stress of trying to be the greatest rhythm gamer of all time, then Neon Drive is probably just right for you.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,1.0,1.0,60.0

Nidhogg 2,PlayStation 4,Messhof,"['Action', 'General']",T,2017-09-15,"Two fighters lock eyes and charge at each other, both wielding their swords with the intent of murdering the other. One stabs low, the other high, and one becomes the victor as the other is disemboweled. As the champion runs, the defeated reappears with a dagger that he lobs, but misses. The sword is thrown in kind and stuck through the combatants head. The victor picks up his sword as he continues on and no sooner has to deflect a bolt that’s quickly shot from a bow, which inadvertently pierces the archer’s heart. It’s here that the winner is crowned with fame after being eaten by the Níðhöggr. If you’ve played Nidhogg, you can pretty much expect the same experience from Nidhogg 2. The largest differences are the amount of weapons available, and the graphics. The latter is quite a large jump from the original, which served its purpose well, but you can’t help but love the Sega feel that is brought about in 2 thanks to Toby Dixon. I highly recommend checking out his Tumblr that goes into the design of the game with Plasticine, as many games don’t make use of this animation method anymore. The game features extravagant backgrounds as you pierce your way through each level, running and jumping to safety. The music is also quite varied between the stages, creating a fun sense of ambiance. The game offers a few modes, including a single-player arcade, online, local versus (2 players), and local tournaments (3-8). The game has the ability to run indefinitely without a time limit, although it’s there for those that would rather not have the game end in a stalemate. This is almost impossible in the likes of the arcade mode, as the game has certain styles to learn as you play. My first time through the game I beat it in 21 minutes, and there’s a trophy for beating it in 20, which is more than doable once you understand the fundamentals. For those that have never played Nidhogg before, the arcade mode is a great place to learn how everything works. There is no tutorial, but the control scheme is hardly difficult. You run, jump, and attack. Attacks are dependent on how you move directionally, so you can be at a low, mid, or high stance. You are also able to throw your weapon, as well as go hand-to-hand or perform a dive kick. You’ll learn what works and what doesn’t while playing against the computer, as the characters more or less showcase the different things you can do with the weapons as you come across them. Some favor high stance, while others are insistent on going for your knees. While the arcade is a fun tutorial of sorts, the main focus of this game is the multiplayer. There’s nothing quite like sitting on the couch next to your buddy and yelling at them as they throw a sword and miss as you curb stomp them out of existence, only to have them stab you in the head as soon as they spawn. It brings back the joys of a simpler time, and it’s just as addictive as the old co-op/competitive games you used to play on Nintendo; just a bit more violent. There are plenty of strategies to playing this game, namely killing your opponent and running. But there are many intricacies to these, as you’ll learn by playing against others. What works well on one person will undoubtedly have a different result on someone else. In some instances, you may only have to kill them once the entire match and run through the rest of it, jumping over them and dodging their attacks. Others will hunt you down and be expert marksmen forcing you to kill them every time they’re on the screen if you hope to make any progress. Finding what their pattern of play is can be difficult, and almost a form of rock, paper, scissors when dueling. Note that whoever has the last kill controls the screen, and moving off of it as the loser means death. In addition to the danger that your opponent brings, the levels also have their own dangers that you must be careful of – many times after winning a duel I ended up falling to my death from rolling to pick up a weapon or just being clumsy. It’s rare that any of these events ever end up in frustration while playing against the computer, but it can mean life or death when going against a human. Nidhogg 2 brings what people loved of the first and amplifies it on every level. The game takes the competitive nature of old games and modernizes it, keeping the controls simple but the gameplay addictive. If you never played the first, don’t worry, this is the perfect game to jump into.",73,Mixed or average reviews,11.0,12.0,1.0,4.8,Generally unfavorable reviews,6.0,3.0,9.0,48.0

NOVA-111,PlayStation 4,Funktronic Labs,"['Sci-Fi', 'Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'General']",E,2015-08-25,"When someone describes a game as “it has some good ideas”, you know you’re hearing the equivalent of being setup on a date with the matchmaker saying “he has a great personality”.  “It has some good ideas” connotes a game isn’t going to be good but the person describing it that way doesn’t want to say it.  Having said all that…Nova-111 has some good ideas.Watching shorts bits of gameplay, you might think this is a strategy game or a rogue-like dungeon crawler but you would be very wrong.  Nova-111 is actually a puzzle game.  You might not even realize this through the first couple of hours because it starts off so slow and boring that by the time it gets interesting you realize there are almost always predefined ways to progress perfectly.  The problem is that the save points are about 20-30 minutes apart which is not something you want from a puzzle game.  Each level is broken up into four screens but you must complete all the screens with no option to save mid level.  Dying will often have you repeat five minutes or more of gameplay to go back to the puzzle where you died.Each new enemy is like a new component to a puzzle when combined with other enemies.  To achieve perfection on levels, you really need to use your brain, however, the game gives you the option to just take a few hits and brute force your way through to the end.  This makes the game too easy and no incentive to solve the clever puzzles other than achieve a better grade at the end.For the most part this is a turn based game but it weirdly often has real time events that are incongruent with the rest of the game and simply doesn’t work.  Many times I died taking a moment to solve a puzzle only to have to restart because something real time killed me.  Upgrades are available to your ship but it really doesn’t affect much other than giving you the power to be even lazier and brute force your way through even more puzzles.  The story is typical puzzle game fluff.I played through the game on PS4 and despite the occasional hard crash that would often cause me to lose 15 minutes of progress, it played fine.  Since there is no cross-save, I only briefly played the Vita version but it ran perfectly.In summary, there is some fun to be had here and some clever and unique gameplay but it is surrounded with too much slogging boring stuff that I can’t recommend it.  Maybe in the sequel it can be improved from a game you just want to be friends with to a love affair.",73,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,5.1,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,7.0,7.0,51.0

Sure, it's grindy, but it doesnt have that ""I HAVE to pay for this stuff, or I cannot play"" feel about it. You can unlock pretty much everything with sufficient grind. And it's not that slow either.It MAY be considered pay to win (or ""pay to win more"", ""pay to grind less""), but it is pure PvE, so who cares really? Some of my friends were surprised that they never heard about the game and even more - that it is free to play. PS: I believe previous reviews were from a different time.

So there is 2d replacement instead. It is HD, but it is lacking the charm. I sugest to check even the original on internet. Also searching for small objects can be pain because of all the aditional enviromnent details that are in the view now.What is same, but aged well: Story + writing, soundrack, voice acting, basic gameplay. Also the world feels really alive. Much more than any recent Bethesda or other game.What is same, but aged poorly: Jumping is really really bad (but not needed so often). And gunplay feels little weird and needs some getting used to. If you did not played this game before, just do yourself favour and buy it. It is awesome story based action adventure (with slight hints of rpg mechanics - it just works in reverse. You are not getting stronger, but enemies weaker. Result is the same).

Overcooked,PlayStation 4,Ghost Town Games Ltd.,"['Action', 'Simulation', 'Arcade', 'Virtual', 'Career']",E,2016-08-02,"Overcooked is quite possibly one of the best co-op games that I've had the pleasure of playing, and I'm always searching for that one game that I can play with my girlfriend.  Other co-ops tend to have an alpha gamer problem and well, that means I'm usually the problem.  Overcooked, on the other hand, distinctly avoids this by gimmicking its levels such that you absolutely must co-operate and co-ordinate if you want to get three stars. As a result, every player is engaged and constantly communicating, which is a good sign your co-op game is doing its job.  Take the basics of something like Diner Dash and throw in the added conundrum of managing resources and logstics, and you have Overcooked.  Rather than simply bashing out recipes and delivering them, each level has a sort of twist to it that requires players to overcome, be it simply the layout, things shifting around, or even terrain effects (yes, there are ice levels).  Quite simply, you can't succeed at this game on your own. Even in single player, you must control two chefs and switch between them in order to solve logistics problems.  While entertaining to a certain point, juggling the campaign by yourself while controlling two chefs clearly demonstrates that the game needs to have human bodies controlling the individual chefs or nothing really gets done.  As the game is designed around couch co-op, it's no wonder single player is frustrating and it's not a hit against the game - you're lucky it's there to begin with. A bonus of Overcooked is that even if you're short on controllers, you can split each controller into halves, so if you have two controllers, you can get four players into the game.  While it can cause a little bit of confusion sharing a single controller between two people, it's a wonderful addition to the game especially considering the price of a Dual Shock 4. Great game.

Pankapu,PlayStation 4,Plug In Digital,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2017-09-19,"There’s something to be said about games that were made a couple decades ago. People always say they were better in the old days. The game was complete at launch, you didn’t need to spend an hour updating it before playing, and it was both difficult and satisfying. So when a game is made in the spirit of an older generation, do those things hold true? Is it nostalgia that makes people love games from the 80s/90s, or were they truly better than modern day titles like Battlefield and Inside? To call this game a metroidvania title would be incorrect, although the game certainly has aspects that make you think of one. There is plenty of optional backtracking to be done if you want to collect everything, as the game has many paths opened up as you gain more Aegis. Amusingly, the “secret” paths are not actually available, or end up useless in the very beginning, and you will feel as if you are being punished for exploring. Each Aegis you acquire has its own appearance, and changes the way the game is played. The initial armament allows you to battle up close and personal with a sword and shield. The second one you come across gives you the ability to double jump, use a bow and arrow, as well as dodge. The third is more magical, with a staff allowing for AoE attacks, dummy clones, and teleportation. As you progress, you’ll enhance each Aegis with both abilities and strength by finding their respective forges and upgrades. In addition to the different Aegis which you will be switching between on the fly for platforming and boss battles, you’ll come across a few Nebula which imbue your weapons with different abilities. These aren’t nearly as important as the abilities provided by the Aegis in your possession, but they will certainly provide different strategies in battle. Some are certainly better than others depending on the mobs you come across. One notable thing regarding these is that they take up the D-Pad, meaning you are forced to use the analog stick for movement. It’s a personal preference, but I love using the D-Pad for platformers, so this was a slight annoyance. The shoulder buttons for changing Aegis worked well though. The difficulty of the game is kind of hard to gauge/explain. It starts off very easy, which is not what you’d expect from the games that inspired it. Later on you’ll die, but not because of the game’s difficulty, per se. Many of my deaths involved pressing the wrong shoulder button for an Aegis. Whether I was floating in a wind gust like a shmup, or trying to avoid giant walls of fire being thrown my way, I’d always inadvertently kill myself. The most frustrating part was knowing exactly what I wanted to do, but not being able to execute it. And it’s right there that they nailed the 80’s/90’s game inspiration. Go back and play Mega Man (yes, the first one) and you’ll see what I mean. Just because you know how to do something, that doesn’t mean you are going to be able to your first attempt. The game’s aesthetic hearkens back to the old Disney games; beautiful backgrounds and animation, with an OST from Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana, Shining Hearts) that you can sit and listen to for a good while without wanting to move on. The game offers a lot more than what you may think at first sight. Beyond what’s been mentioned, there are also time trials for each level that you play, giving incentive to head back once you complete the game and see if you can beat the best times. There’s nothing like a bit of competition to add a level of replayability to an already complete package. The gameplay overall is fairly solid, with a few assortments to the levels, plenty of collectibles for upgrading not only your gear and skills, but also your life and anima (read: magic). I never ran into any weird hit-boxes; enemies all had their own tells, and nothing ever felt cheap. There was a part nearing the end of the game in which the Kickstarter backers are featured throughout that I had become seemingly stuck, so I started over and found it was just a minor glitch. Many games that are created with the help of Kickstarter end up being a disappointment in one way or another. There are a few notable exceptions, such as Shovel Knight and Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero. I’d like to think that Pankapu: The Dreamkeeper also falls into the successful Kickstarter field, as it held true to many of its promises. If you’re looking for a fun callback to the games of the past with modern influences, look no further than here.

Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Overdrive,PlayStation 4,5pb,"['Action', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", '2D']",E10+,2015-07-23,"picked this one up purely on a whim around release without reading much about it.  a chibi magical girl beat em up with an old school 32-bit sega saturn vibe complete with pure FM tuneage AND online play?  yes please. i was not disappointed, in fact i was blown away.  i expected a diversion for a few nights and this game has really stuck with me.  right off the bat though, i'll just say that if you don't enjoy games that follow the japanese tradition of spectacle brawlers with a technical emphasis (DMC, dragon's crown, bayonetta, etc.) then this one isn't gonna do much for you. it is a straight-up brawler with absolutely no deviation from the classic formula (why fix what ain't broken after all?) beyond the combat system bringing many of the complexities of modern fighting games into play (guard cancel, air dash, tech'ing throws and knockdowns, parries and evasive manuevers and hyper-armor ""focus"" attacks and combo-breakers and EX meters and... you get the point lol).  this mixture of old and new feels so good and it's obvious how much of an emphasis the devs have placed on solid controls and gratuitous player feedback. it's incredibly satisfying to parry an opponent, launch a special attack, juggle them with toss-ups and mid-air throws to build your meter back over the course of 3-4 seconds and then finish them off with your ultra.  by the time your 700-hit combo is over, the individual sounds of the coins and xp blobs hitting the ground becomes so dense that they blur into one grinding tone that decays over the course of several seconds.   hell yeah - this is what i came for. the difficulty is excellent and things really do ramp up as you progress.  even at max level the later difficulties are still very challenging, and while the early to mid game can certainly be mashed through by those who are uninterested in the finer details, the bosses and challenge sections will shut these players down really fast as well.  some truly epic boss battles that revolve around fighting other characters primarily and will really require you to use all of the techniques.  you can also just level the **** up; the leveling system acts as a good tool to let players manage their own level of challenge in an organic way. and speaking of challenge, i have never seen so many enemies on-screen in a brawler before (the only way you will be able to pick out your character sometimes is by the flash of their strikes), but i've also never seen a brawler that gives you the tools you need to tackle that kind of density.  the most complex move on an execution level is something like:   => - => - HP+LP, but because of the mobile, multi-hit nature of so many of these attacks and the fluidity and synergy between them and L/H/M attack chains and dash attacks, you are dancing around the room with a range of versatility, mobility and reach that we often only see in fighting games with convoluted inputs and single-frame links. again, it all feels GREAT.  if you take one thing away from my review, know that the game just feels good to play.  each character requires a certain finesse to use effectively and they've all been thought-out really well (although it could easily be argued certain characters are more than a little OP and as such you will see them dominating PvP). and speaking of PvP, ii'd just like to say that it is almost purely prediction-based with solid netcode and a stupidly high skill-ceiling - i've fought players who i literally could not even touch and i've finished the game on it's hardest difficulty with almost every character.  if that sounds appealing to you, dive right in, but just be aware of how creamed you are likely going to get. and to end it, i'll go into the look and performance, two things that matter the least to me when it comes to a system mastery game like this.  i adore the cheesy aesthetic and the animations are elastic, expressive and satisfying - they match the tone of the game perfectly and i am always noticing new little details in them even after dozens of hours of playing.  there's a decent enemy variety with an emphasis on surreal japanese humor and alright-looking cel-shaded backgrounds; if anything that is my one complaint with the game, that i wish they had gone for hand-drawn backgrounds instead.  i think that would've been a little bit outside of this game's budget though considering how much detail they put into the character sprites and animations and in the end, since they are the focus of the action, that was a wise decision imo.  it runs at a solid 60FPS and i have never experienced a single dip in the action, even in nightmare+ mode with hundreds (yes, hundreds) of enemies on-screen at once with 3-4 local players and everyone's special attacks flying. highly recommended to all fans of brawlers and technical action games, i can almost guarantee you will find something to love here.",72,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,Mixed or average reviews,5.0,1.0,1.0,70.0

Large enemies to deal with, groups of multiple enemies to deal with... some with cheap feeling ranged swords… and of courses brutal bossesand this is where managing your gear comes into play..Do you want to be protected and do tons of damage for this battle at the cost of losing stamina quickly... or will you need to do more dodging, sacrificing defense for speed, or attack power for stamina...it’s a tricky balancing act that makes ever boss encounter feel overcomable if you try just one more time..And this is where the game hooks you and it’s a great hook...My issues with this game are few... but they’re large issues…Firstly… there’s an annoying enemy locking on your character will do... they won’t automatically lock into the bosses or even the closest enemy... Its random at time...and because of this id waste precious magic that doesn’t regenerate on an enemy behind a barrier that popped up instead of using it on the bosses...This was way more frequent than it should be…And the game doesn’t seem to scale weapon drops with location…After defeating a boss I went to a new world where ordinary enemies felt like bosses because the weapon I just defeated the previous boss with no problem, was doing no damage to these new enemies..It just didn’t make sense...almost like the game wants to force grinding on your which is made a little easier thanks to fast travel points and barrier fights not having to be repeated letting you roll past enemies you don’t want to deal with…but forced grind is never a good thing… this difficulty spike came out of nowhere and was far too steep…But again as a side scrolling dark souls like game.. You know what to expect...prepare to die... prepare to grind...Prepare to lose progress when you slip up on a trap on you’re to collecting your dropped experienceI give Pharaonica 6.5/10",0,No score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,2.0,0.0,73.0

Had so much fun reliving the story and enjoying the updated graphics, anyone who loves JRPG's particularly the classic Lunar, Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star owe it to themselves to play this game. The puzzles are challenging in a way similar to the RPG's of the 16-bit era. The music is a masterpiece within itself and the graphics are beautiful whether you choose the original 16 bit graphics or the remastered HD variant. It has its own unique feel as well as having its own battle system which oozes originality in bounds and really ups the ante in terms of fighting strategically. All in all I highly recommend this game for everyone, You can pick it up on many platforms from PC/MAC/LINUX Dreamcast PS3/PS4 OUYA with XBOX ONE and Wii U And Vita coming soon. You must play it, its one of the best JRPG's this century!",69,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,5.0,0.0,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,25.0,5.0,8.0,73.0

Then when i seen this come out on the PSVR i had to give it a go and i am so glad i did. The graphics are fine and you can change your view once in the game by looking up or down and holding start to recenter the VR. I like to play nice and close as i think the graphics and the way the tables look are amazing. The walking dead pinball table is a great addition to my room but only having 3 tables at a time is quite annoying as if i had a real room like this virtual one there would be a lot more than 3 tables. That said once you are on the table you forget about that fact and are focused on beating previous scores and trying to beat the table. If you have a VR and you are reading this i would recommend that you buy the game and give it a go, the three tables included are fun enough and if like me you enjoy it then buy yourself some more tables and hopefully i will see you on the scoreboard in future. ProsGraphicsGreat table movementRealistic feel to the tablesCostAdditional tables ConsHaving to look down can lead to a sore neck which can limit table time.",80,Generally favorable reviews,20.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,Mixed or average reviews,7.0,3.0,2.0,70.0
Pinball FX3,PlayStation 4,Zen Studios,"['Action', 'Pinball']",E10+,2017-09-26,"This is a cutdown version of my review posted on Reddit (sorry linking not allowed and it's too long to post in full here) Pinball FX3 is the latest pinball game from Zen Studios and out on PS4 Xbox and pc. All of the core gameplay from the last game remains but has been expanded in some new and rather interesting ways, more on that later.One of the first things I should mention is how deeply I am impressed with the developers of this game, the core game is free and includes one table however you are able to import almost all of your old tables from Zen Pinball 2 (FX2 on the pc). This means the game has a very impressive starting line up of tables and previous customers are not asked to re-buy tables again to get access to the new features, in this day and age that loyalty to fans is a rare commodity.New to this version is the “Upgrades” system, this allows you to level up score multipliers, bumper scores etc to give you a bit of an edge on the tables. These upgrades can be used in the new “Match up” and “Tournament” modes along with Wizard powers!So what are Wizard powers? Sadly you can not unleash fireballs on your rival pinballers, what you get is a lot more useful and leaves fewer soot stains!There are 3 Wizard powers per table;Rewind timeScore BoostSlow motionTo earn the Wizard powers you play the new challenge modes.Each table has 3 challenges, the first two are self-explanatory 1 ball and 5-minute time limit. The 3rd challenge is survival, which gives you a 60 second time limit to reach a target goal, once you hit that goal the target is increased and the timer reset. All of these modes are fun to play and help you get a good feel for the table.The Tournament mode allows you to go up against the world (all systems share the same scoreboards for these) by creating a set of rules, a time limit of anything from 1 day to a week and picking a table or playing someone else's. The options you have are immense and yes you can turn off the Wizard powers and upgrades to make for a level playing field. Personally, I am partial to the 5-minute tournaments where you have to score as many points as you can in 5 minutes.The last new game mode is “Match up” this is more your official huge tournament, 4 tables are picked by the zen studio guys at the start of each week and you can play them all (if you own all of them) or just keep replaying your favourite. Each table has 3 scores you can choose to beat, think of them as easy, medium and Hard if you beat the score you choose within the 3-minute time limit you get some points (you get bonus points for playing more tables and/or dominating your chosen score. At the end of the week, those in the top 20% move to the next league of the tournament and those in the bottom 20% drop back to the last league. Given that all systems compete in the same tournament it can be pretty tough to get in the last 20% and sadly it does mean that those with more time to play will fair better regardless of skill. PROSRealistic ball physics.A huge improvement over the last game which was already rather good.You can import already owned tablesHuge list of tables (68 in fact)Every table is fully featured and animated, the detail that goes into these is awe inspiring.The new tournament mode allows you to challenge people long after your mates have looked at your high scores and backed away shaking their heads.The unlock system is a unique idea in pinball and one I found really enjoyable.It really is the best pinball game I have ever played (and I have been playing them on and off since pinball fantasies on the Amiga!)All three main systems share the scores and tournaments, that is a lot of people to play against.It is a free game (with 1 free table)You can trail any table for 5 minutes as many times as you want before purchase. CONSNot all the tables made it over to FX3 (including my old favourite, Plants vs Zombies) it is my hope they will be added later though I suspect there were licensing issues.Due to the way tables are sold in packs, it is possible to have a table or two from importing that is in the pack meaning you may have to re-buy some tables to get the missing ones (far from ideal)Die-hard pinball fans may not like the upgrade system, but it is optional.New users only get one table free.Despite the “match up” mode being 3 minutes long and the trials of tables being 5 minutes, you can not use the trial versions of tables in match up. VERDICTWell, I said it in the Pro section, this is the best pinball game I have ever played the mix of realistic ball physics and unrealistic but awesome table features, it really is a hell of a lot of fun. Add in the competitive features and the fact that all major systems can compete together in the tournaments and you have an amazing game.So yes I recommend it, grab yourself some tables too.",78,Generally favorable reviews,7.0,2.0,0.0,5.7,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,2.0,4.0,57.0

Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare,PlayStation 4,PopCap,"['Action', 'General', 'Shooter', 'Third-Person', 'Tactical']",E10+,2014-08-19,"PvZ is definitely not a traditional shooter by any means and that is what makes it great. I found this game to be something really special. It takes the fundamentals of the played out shooter genre (which I actually am a fan of) and adds a ridiculous theme from one of my favorite mobile games. But besides my personal interests, the game itself is actually incredibly well designed and Ill cut to the chase.Pros:-Fun for all ages-Lots of customization and character variation (4 classes per side, type variations for each class and ability)Peashooter and Fire PeashooterAllstar and Hockey player version-Exciting game modes=Team Death Match (Feels right at home)Garden and Graveyards (Simplified version of BF rush mode)Gnome Bomb (Comparable to BF Obliteration mode)Suburbanization (Domination)Taco Bandits (Kinda like CTF, Zombies try to steal a taco from plants 3 times)-Free Updates (The last one included the latter 2 game modes and tons of customization items)-Easy to play/ Not stressfulThe game was my saving grace from games like Battlefield or KZ Shadow Fall (Still play them). Honestly its hard to be mad at this game.. Sure some idiot on your team will bring the taco back towards the plants but its just so lighthearted and silly that you'll probably just laugh. I hope.-Everything feels very well balancedWhether in TDM or a completely attack and defend game mode like G&G; or Taco, the game never really feels too unbalanced. One team may out rank the other round continuously win but the design of the game is very even across the board. Zombies geared to attack and plants better for defending like they are supposed to but it just works.-Garden Ops (Horde mode)This is actually a lot different from the main multiplayer and its a great change up. The goal is to survive 10 waves and escape aboard Crazy Dave's flying RV. The game is fun and really focuses on the team working together and having a good balance of classes. The amount of maps and locations within each one plus the variety of bonus waves and bosses keeps this fresh and fun. Cons:-No single player storyI haven't been a huge fan of really any FPS story but I feel with the setting of this and the characters they could have actually made an engaging campaign. Hell you could have done two with perspectives from the zombies and plants alike.. I guess its probably better that they left it out rather then screwed it up but maybe in a sequel.-Garden Ops, unlike my experience in Multiplayer, can get very buggy which needs a tune up. Not always though thankfully. This game is some serious fun and a real change from the mundane other FPS games you might be playing. It is great for literally anyone and I would recommend it highly. Trying to not be biased and see it from all perspectives I do think this game deserves a higher score than it has. It might have a few bug issues that could be fixed but as a whole it is very well built, almost surprisingly so. Because I expect a fix to the problems in Garden Ops and that is the only bad thing in my mind this get a 10/10. Play it. Its fun.",75,Generally favorable reviews,16.0,6.0,1.0,7.6,Generally favorable reviews,185.0,66.0,27.0,76.0

Pure Hold 'Em,PlayStation 4,VooFoo Studios,"['Miscellaneous', 'Gambling']",T,2015-08-18,"Pure Hold’em costs a pricey $20 in a world where free phone and PC games exists to play Texas Hold’em.  It attempts to make the case for $20 on presentation because it definitely doesn’t have many features.  Hope you like standard Texas Hold’em because that is only thing to be played here.  Your options are to play in tournaments that require waiting around for enough players, open tables of an unbalanced drop in and out, and AI play of playing standard video game stereotypes of imaginary people. Pure Hold’em is by the same makers of Pure Pool so it exists in a world where objects move around with any humans.  Just like Pure Pool the presentation and visuals are top notch and it might be the most beautiful poker game ever made.  In game music is a diverse selection but after hours of playing you are going to turn it off and listen to Spotify. The AI is terrible and will slow play you to boredom.  Do not buy to play single player. Gameplay and controls are smooth and intuitive and the pace of play remains as fast as possible.  There is no way for other players to communicate without always horrible sounding voice chat.  A few quick text commands would have be a welcome addition.  There were too many different levels of tables to play with no browser that worries me that it may be hard to get in a game in the future. My biggest issue with the game is the currency system.  It is confusing on how the fake money is obtained and how much is lost per game with no explanation given.  There is no pay-to-play hounding you to pay real money for more currency and I never ran out of money. It is a necessary evil to have a currency system to prevent users from going all-in on first hands and popping between games quickly and it does the job here. I am having a lot of fun with Pure Hold’em and it plays a great game that keeps me occupied for hours.  It is hard to be revolutionary with Texas Hold’em game.  The best thing a poker videogame can do is keep up the pace of the game and be visually pleasing and Pure Hold’em accomplishes that task.

Pure Pool,PlayStation 4,VooFoo Studios,"['Alternative', 'Other', 'Sports', 'Miscellaneous', 'Parlor', 'Individual', 'Billiards']",E,2014-07-29,"Response to pithing_needle on the 31st of July. Yeah I understand what you are saying dude and to some extent I agree with you, the angle viewing could be better and markers but none of that detracts from the game quality.  I prefer no power bar, no chalk, no gimmicks, just Pure Pool! I find the table very good so each to their own opinion, lets meet up and have a few games online!  There are server issues with launch which they are fixing and is not anything to do with the game itself but rather the servers... I also agree it is harder to play opponents who are like minded and don't use aids etc, it seems you need to create a League or know your opponent and challenge them, the Quick Match I never used in HK since it would match me up with full aiming lines! Interestingly I played Virtual Pool 3 and Virtual Pool Hall a lot on the PC and was involved in the world leagues, I was ranked 9th at one point many moons ago...but never played 4... Original Review: I disagree with pithing_needle...I play pool for my pub team and this pool simulation is by far the nearest thing I've ever played on a console to real life. The game drips in quality and oozes class. The 1080p and 60fps does it justice but the game itself feels very right when you play it. I found the table speed very good, I felt the amount of power I pulled back with on the cue reflected what I wanted to do in the shot and love the fact that aiming lines are not so accurate. I much prefer no aiming lines but the angle you view the shots with can be hard to judge so the little circle makes sense so you can at least tell which side of the object ball you are hitting. Online play was smooth and seamless...I too would prefer to weed out those using a line but there must be a way to do this. In Hustle Kings if you went to a Quick Match you got a random person who may have used lines too but then in HK you could create rooms that specified no aiming lines. More time is needed on Pure Pool. This is by the far the best pool simulation game ever and deserves a 10/10 for me. The fact that The Last of Us Remastered edition is still in its wrapper shows how addictive this game is.",75,Generally favorable reviews,10.0,4.0,0.0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,43.0,23.0,9.0,71.0

You will also see that there is no loading time when you enter or exit a level, which makes the navigation even faster and more enjoyable. Ubisoft has also integrated a new Camera Mode on PS4. By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you’re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick). Finally, in this PS4 version, you’ll also find new playable heroes: Assassin Ray (a character inspired by Edward Kenway, the hero of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag), Funky Ray (a delusional character that you can unlock by using Uplay points), and Champion Ray (a character who will be offered to the best players of the community and those who live in this community; this character correspond to the new VIP status, visible in the rankings of online challenges).

Here's a quick review of each one: 1) 21 is a card game mode that is the best of the three, which mixes Saw and poker into a interesting and brutal game of life and death. The downsides are learning through death and luck to win and the quick voice transitions from their painful moments instantly destroys the tension and fear buldup, turning to frustration. Add that to a unskippable loading of the same trap you just died from readied again gets worse. At its best, its fun and goofy in a dark humor way, but at worst its polarizing for players. 2) If 21 was humorous through its dark humor, then Jack's 55th Birthday destroys that with pure comedy that detaches itself from the horror vibe completely. Similar to Raid and Mercenaries, you are tasked to feed Jack by exploring the house and killing enemies to stall the timer, achieve under that limit and progress to the next stage. The issues though come by the inventory management and recycling of new areas. ""Crafting"" better foods for Jack to consume can be a bit of pain as there is no ""sliding"" effect items had in say like RE5, where you could just place the object on the other and it did it instantly. Considering this is a time based event, this can take alot of your time up and prove irritating for players. The areas you traverse through is only six, yet repeat not only on places you HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN when playing the story, but REPEAT AGAIN when you do their harder versions! The humor is also way too much, as in its more annoying than cute. This makes the questioning of having this as dlc even more apparent, and that's not even including the biggest upset of them all. 3) Daughters had the best potential to be the best part of the DLC. With a story that struggled with character development and writing, having a prequel would answer some questions we had about the beginnings. While there is something here, Daughters is still a terrible piece of content that (much like Bedroom) should have been a part of the main game's story in the form of a tape that you got as your progressed. It's setup is once again in the same house (surprisingly still trashed like before when you first play the game) and offers extremely little. Playing as Zoey should have been an opportunity to get to know her better considering she had virtually no real development or likability  in the base game. Even after playing a hour (beating it twice in that time and going VERY slow to boot), I barely knew anything  I haven't already learned before from the base in-game documents. It ends before it even starts, and even with a second ending, there is very little to change that feels like real progress. It's linear through and through. It's on par with Bedroom in terms of length (yes, both runs combined is about the same full length of Bedroom) and general terrible lack of content to them. As said, Banned Footage Vol. 2 should have been content apart of the game at launch, no exception. If everything was included, I would be more forgiving but to charge $15 dollars (including $10 for Banned Footage Vol. 1), this is a inexcusable display of greed from Capcom. Considering there is only $5 dollars left from the Season Pass for a ""Story Episode"", Capcom has only one swing left before striking out RE7 as a cashgrab rather than the RE game we have been waiting for since RE4.",67,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,8.0,0.0,5.3,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,4.0,4.0,53.0

Resident Evil 7: biohazard - Gold Edition,PlayStation 4,Capcom,"['Action Adventure', 'Survival']",M,2017-12-12,"Resident Evil 7 - Gold Edition can also be called another thing for me; a complete game. My biggest issues with Resident Evil 7 when it first came out was the lack of endgame content that it brought out. The base game itself was good and rock solid for delivering a tense survival horror experience that nostalgically grabs old fans of the Resident Evil series while also being different enough to attract new players at the same time. Unfortunately the game lacked content until the Banned Footage DLCs came out, and based on the price for those DLCs on top of the $60 price tag was polarizing at best and absolute shameful and bad at worst. The six additions all felt like bite sized snacks and distractions (excluding arguably Nightmares) rather than fully fleshed out concepts and designs. Personally, this should have been apart of the base game and when hearing there was only one thing left to impress me, I was ready to sign off the whole game as a cash grab that lost its potential to the corporate sharks at Capcom. Fortunately I was wrong and they manage to pull through with two solid (if short) entries. Not A Hero and End of Zoe both act as an epilogue to the base game and feel just enough to be worthwhile (if only for a few runs). Not A Hero is a more action tense experience in which you play as Chris Redfield who must hunt down a certain character to close out the finale of the base game proper while also showing some of the events taken place as things progress. It's a challenging chapter that has you up against enemies and traps that require some thinking and cautious. While only being a 1 and half to two hour experience the dlc is free for anyone who buys the game or this version and at least serves as a much better ending and possible future for the series. End of Zoe takes a completely different tone, taking weeks after Not A Hero and the base game, where you play as one of the Baker family members who is desperate to save one of his own. The combat and change up is refreshing and sometimes really cool. It makes the single boss  satisfying if a little predictable and repetitive on movesets too. The story to both are okay I suppose on their own, but if taking the entire game and its DLC as a whole, it actually tells a interesting narrative of the Bakers and the secrets they carry. For those that have not done so, I would recommend buying Resident Evil 7-  Gold Edition as Capcom have released the game (in my opinion) the way it should have been at launch. The main game will take about 8-10 hours with Not A Hero and End of Zoe adding another 3 hours. The six mini DLC will vary, but one adds a ludicrously hard mode, another adds a survival mode and time attack mode, and three are mini-stories that can be completed altogether in 30-60 minutes. Overall, this will provide enough content and replay value to last you awhile. I don't agree with the idea that giving you so many hours of gameplay instantly makes it worth your money, rather the experience of the time and quality put into it is what I concern myself more for. In conclusion, Resident Evil 7 ""The Actual Full-Game It Should've Been At Launch"" Edition is worth a chance for anyone interested in Resident Evil, survival horror, or both. While it's not perfect and its VR for the PS is sickening to my stomach to this day, I can say if you want to try it it might amplify your blind runs far better and be more immersed as a result. It still has yet to be a true comeback for the series old roots, but makes a good attempt regardless and that right there is worth playing it for.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,0.0,2.0,65.0

Risk of Rain,PlayStation 4,Hopoo Games,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2016-04-12,"Probably the best couch coop game I have ever played. This incredibly good game can get very hard but it always remains fair! The items you find through the levels have the possibility to transform your character into a killing machine that will give you a fighting chance against your enemies. Don't be turned off by the difficulty getting harder and harder as time advances. I was sceptical at first but it turns out to be a great game mechanic that will keep you focused and motivated. You cannot take your time, ""clear the stage"" and find all the items. If you do you're going to get crushed pretty soon. On the other hand, you cannot rush to the teleporter without taking a few items with you. It's all about balance. Look around and find a few items quickly... then find that teleporter! The music in this game is amazingly good and fits the mood perfectly. I would listen to these tracks on their own without playing any game. They're that good. The only problem I can think of is that the levels are not purely randomly generated. There are some variations in each stage and the items are not always located at the same place... but after a few runs you will instinctively know where to find the items and how to explore each level. Though it's not a huge deal as there is still a LOT of replayability with this game. I got this game under $5 on PSPlus... a steal.",81,Generally favorable reviews,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.5,Generally favorable reviews,13.0,3.0,3.0,75.0

Road Rage,PlayStation 4,Maximum Games,"['Simulation', 'Vehicle', 'Combat']",M,2017-11-14,"The game is an open world racer in the vein of the most recent Forza Horizon games, but looks more like a GTA San Andreas clone, albeit one in which you can’t leave your motorcycle. Like any open world game, the world is divided up into districts. Sadly, it’s not open for much exploration off the rip; if you leave the area your current objectives are on, you’ll immediately gain the attention of the law enforcement in the area and they will try and likely succeed at making you eat the pavement. These pesky officers of the law will also show up later in the game to add some additional mechanics to the often stale and repetitive game. You’ll spend your time driving from point A to point B, occasionally picking up packages, assassinating other riders, picking up on circuit races, and performing style challenges. This is the bulk of the game, which does tend to get boring fairly quickly, as the title is very reliant on grinding. As you progress through the story missions, new districts will open up, which will lead to side objectives that can be completed for money. The earnings will be used to purchase new bikes, upgrades for said bikes, as well as weapons and items. Unfortunately, you have to unlock a certain number of extras to proceed, and the map does not show you the requirements until you drive to the marker to start the mission. This lead me on a wild goose chase multiple times looking for the next mission so I could move on with my current build. The game is quite buggy, and I was subject to a large number of glitches ranging from invisible walls to being catapulted for no reason. The game often seemed to forget that I had died and left me to watch my rider lay on the pavement, forcing me to restart the event. Respawns are also an issue at times, as the game will drop you into the world from a highly elevated point, at which point you explode; this happened repeatedly in some instances. The game’s visuals are on par with most late PS2/early PS3 games, and do not take advantage of the current-gen hardware in any obvious way. With a lot of texture popping and clipping, as well as a grey tone that’s washed over everything, Road Rage is kind of ugly to look at. Additionally, the character models are very static. You’ll sit on your bike with your weapon always at your side, and even when taking sharp turns, your rider never moves, almost like it’s an action figure stuck to an RC toy. The only exception to this is when you collide with certain obstacles in the game, which is weird because some that would result in certain death are ignored (if not driven through), and others that shouldn’t cause issue send you flying, as if you’re playing the Insurance Fraud mini-game from Saint’s Row. The sound design isn’t much better, featuring a synch rock techno-ish soundtrack from the 90’s as well as boorish, poorly acted voice overs. Since the text pushing the story forward is displayed in a group text chat format (yeah, that annoying thing your mother or most annoying friend does), I found myself cranking my own heavy metal music and skipping the sound all together fairly early into my time with the title. The controls and AI don’t fare much better, as the other riders will regularly veer off and slam into buildings for no good reason, which makes losing pretty difficult. Your worst adversary is going to be the controls, which most of the time feel as if you pushed the button to turn or brake 5+ seconds before the game reacts. This is less of an issue when you are the only racer on the screen; however, when 6 or so racers are present, with the open world atmosphere, the game barely runs at 30FPS and the aforementioned issue becomes more of a serious problem. The only remedy I found for this was to get ahead and stay there, which actually makes for a decent racing experience. The combat, which you’d think would be at the forefront of the game, is also awkward. When you get within range of another racer, you’ll hit a button that will enter combat mode, which serves as an auto-aim like feature that conveniently pulls you closer to the racer and allows you to take a few swings at them. Due to the nature of the poor physics engine, this is a mess as well, since you or the racer you want to attack will likely hit another racer, invisible wall, or something from the game world, ending the battle before it even started. The sheer chaos this brings when in a large group is good for a laugh, but not much else. For more details, you can read the full review at Garage Band Gamers.",27,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,0.0,13.0,2.6,Generally unfavorable reviews,3.0,0.0,13.0,26.0

Rory McIlroy PGA Tour,PlayStation 4,EA Tiburon,"['Traditional', 'Sports', 'Individual', 'Golf', 'Sim']",E,2015-07-14,"Gameplay offers multiple ways to play, including arcade controls where the left stick is used to control power and accuracy, with the ability to add spin to the shot while the ball is in the air. In addition to the arcade controls, the return of 3-Click swings appeals to nostalgic gamers who prefer to set power and accuracy by tapping a button rather than moving a thumbstick. Those looking for an extra challenge can turn on Tour settings. When playing with Tour controls, the length of your backswing and speed of your follow through determine power, while the club path through the ball will be the most important factor in accounting for accuracy. Fans can also mix and match all three settings to create their own custom gameplay style. Courses themselves also affect how your shots are played, as firmer, links-style courses like St. Andrews provides more bounce and roll, while softer courses such as TPC Sawgrass have less bounce and be more receptive to spin.

So, I got stuck on a boss, which just **** me up, just because his random attacks are so stupid and unfair at times, I can't dodge them and die, die, die.

SkyKeepers,PlayStation 4,Sword Twin Studios,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2017-03-31,"SkyKeepers by #SwordTwinStudios is a brilliantly written Story about a young boy who looks up to his father who is the Cheif of their Tribe. Our Main character Palagi wants nothing more in the world than for his father Tangi to let him become a Man. Becoming a Man is a rite of passage and the steps to becoming a Man include several trials and tests to prove the type of Man you are Physically and Mentally as well as the final Physical portion which includes venturing off into the dangerous Forest filled with the wild Wa'Kine Tribe who attack their very existence. While in the dangerous forest you must collect the perfect log and an Oataota Plant which the tribe elders will then make into the ink that will be used to give the new Man his first TATUA which makes the becoming a Man ceremony official. Being a Man of the tribe especially the Cheif involves spending days in the forest fighting off and keeping the Wa'Kine tribe and other enemies away from the village and tribes people.Young Palagi finishes his chores early one day while his Mother is away and goes off into the woods to find his father who is fighting off the dangers and evil who would attack their tribe if given the opportunity. He finds his Father and tells him he wants to become a man and for some reason unlike the many many other times he said now he allowed Palagi to take on the first challenge almost as if he expected him to fail so they could go home and his point would be proved that Palagi is not yet ready to be a Man. Tangi's plan is suddenly ruined when Palagi is able to Skywalk and do other magical things that only Tribe Men are able to do so he agrees it is time for Palagi to become a man and they set off on their journey to start the process and rite of passage of Palagi becoming a MAN. Father and Son take the process step by step seeing the Tribe elders and then going to find the special Log and Oataota plant to make the Ink for Palagi's first Tatua but because the Forest has recently been getting over run with evil the Oataota Plant Palagi picks is glowing bright red with a sort of aura around it. By the time they get back and the Tribe elder and Father ask Palagi if it was red infused with evil and that they could go get another safer plant another day Palagi being too excited ends up Lying and saying that it was not Red. The Tribe elder makes his ink with the Ash from the log and the Oataota Plant and begins Palagi's first Tatua but Palagi is in much more pain than he should be yelling out even yelling through his Fathers words to fight it off but they soon realize things are much worse than they thought and Palagi is in much more danger than they ever could have expected.The Games story take a sudden turn at this point, a true plot twist and this left me in awe not really knowing how to feel at this point since everything up to this point was so light and funny especially the banter back and forth between Father and Son.I went on playing SKYKEEPERS and through the stories twists and turns I found a game with a story that really held a tight grip on me. I could nto put the controller down until I new what was going to happen next. When you play SKYKEEPERS for yourself you will learn the fate of Palagi, Tangi and the Tribe but for now I felt it was important to not give any more story details and let them unfold for you for the first time so you can feel what I felt.Over all SKYKEEPERS is an incredibly well developed game and the story is in line with some of the best games I have ever had the pleasure to play. My Nalyo Gaming Quick Review Rundown Score for SKYKEEPERS is an 8.5 / 10 (Great).",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
Skylanders Imaginators,PlayStation 4,Toys for Bob,"['Action', 'Platformer', '3D']",E10+,2016-10-16,"Best entry since Swap Force. I have had some problems with the game design and sloppy coding of Trap Team which made me decide not to buy Superchargers. Now I decided to return and try out Imaginators and overall it is great. The in a short review: If you know the Skylanders games, the levels will of course be different but not much out of the ordinary. They are well designed and the story feels more compelling than previously. Creation works great, The M.A.P. is a welcome feature and overall this is a game worth buying. In more details The story and cutscenes integrate really well into the game, making the basic characters (Spyro, Stealth Elf, etc.) a more integral part of the storytelling which works great. The story and cutscenes gets my attention a lot more than previous entries.Also Kaos, while still sort of an unintelligent villain, feels like he is a lot more of a threat this time. I can take him a lot more serious which does a lot for the overall feel af the game. Having a good villain means a lot. I will not go so much into creating your own character. Its an incredible feature which has already got its attention. There is tons of loot to unlock and you can expect that it may be a bit of a grind fest. What I will like to mention is the M.A.P. which is the world map that has tons of things to unlock. It feels vast, and there are lots of things and places to explore.The M.A.P. serves as the level selection but there are also elemental gates, ambushes where you will enter a combat area, and lots of hidden treasures and places.The M.A.P. feature is very welcome and a feature that I have missed since I played my first Skylanders game (I came in at Swap Force). The levels are not out of the ordinary, but this time they do not lock things away so you have to buy new characters. Instead there are things on the map you can unlock by having more characters and also in the creation part.I have really enjoyed every level so far and I will enjoy the rest, I am sure. The only thing that may seem a bit out of place is that you can buy Mystery Chests, for real money, that will give you in game gear. There is no need for buying these since all can be unlocked in game. The digital Mystery Chests are the same as the blind bagged chests except you can choose what kind of chest you get. Overall Skylanders Imaginators is the best Skylanders game to the date. My favorite part, besides creating your own character, is the M.A.P. and the fact that there is more to do and explore after completing the game. That is to me a winning factor",79,Generally favorable reviews,41.0,8.0,0.0,5.3,Mixed or average reviews,12.0,0.0,12.0,53.0

Skylar & Plux: Adventure on Clover Island,PlayStation 4,"Grip Games, Right Nice Games","['Action', 'Platformer', '3D']",E,2017-05-19,"Tight and responsive controls, moving around in the world as Skylar feels great! The controls are easy enough to learn but there are options for players that are looking for a harder challenge. Try ""roll-jumping"" everywhere! Once you master the tricky precision you will be able to get around very quickly. I feel like they really nailed the difficulty curve with the levels. In the beginning you can pretty much run and smash while you learn the controls but later they hit you with some tricky platforming that requires you to combine several of your powers. Combat is fairly straight forward but keeps you engaged nicely between platforming areas. The puzzles are great, though maybe a tad simple. I really enjoyed the time-shift puzzles, some of them really blew my mind. I wish they would've made more of them. The game looks stunning. Even on my potato on medium it looked awesome and ran flawlessly. Really enjoyed the aesthetics. Solid sound effects and great music. The music especially is very well produced. Maaybe missing a super-catchy pop song in there. Nice casual story that doesn't take itself too seriously, which I really enjoyed. I found the voice acting to be completely satisfactory. To summarize: + Great controls + Great platforming + Cool puzzles + Difficulty + Cheap+ High quality music+ Looks amazing+ Chill story that doesn't take itself too seriously- A little bit short- Moar puzzles- Buff jump-and-stomp attack.

The training levels in this DLC are very 'barebones', but they're certainly challenging enough and they have a certain amount of appeal to those of you who thought the base game was too easy. Personally, I wasn't particularly excited when I realized that the entire DLC is just some really hard training battles where the odds are stacked against you. I'm sure there are people out there who love this type of challenge, though. Danger Deck isn't bad, but it's not exactly what I'd call great either. If you loved the battle system in this game, but wanted more of a challenge from it, then Danger Deck is right up your alley. If not, then this is going to either frustrate or bore the hell out of you. The difficulty level in this DLC cannot be changed, so if you find yourself unable to beat the three stages required for a reward item, then be prepared to not be able to make any progress in it. My rating for this ""expansion"" may seem a bit harsh, but the quality of the content reflects that of a game update that would typically be added into a game for free, thus I brutally have to declare that Danger Deck provides relatively little and appeals only to people who wanted more difficult battles, and nothing more.

I find games like fat princess adventures to be hilarious while others may look at me strange for saying this… but bathroom humor just doesn’t quite tickle my funny bone, though the game did manage to get few laughs out of me... but not necisarily with the ridiculous things going on like giving an abortion to stans dad, or farting all over the place to progress through the levels.. But when the game would sarcastically make fun of itself... these were the best moments for me as someone not really a fan of the TV show…I feel like you need to be a fan to truly enjoy this and get the belly laughs I’ve heard so much about before playing...There’s so much fan service here…The entire town is mapped out and can be freely explored with tons of collectibles…You can do side quests... search the characters drawers for junk, to sell for some pocket change, collect frustratingly missable collectibles like chimpokomonIt will keep fans of the show entertained for hours…The biggest mistake I feel this game makes though is the whole having to fart or use these different abilities to progress…It feels a little awkward switching through fart types, or shooting an object then switching to give commands…I could’ve done without this needless slowdown…Shooting arrows is fine for the collectible aspect or knocking things down in the environment, setting up traps to kill enemies before you get into a battle with them… but I feel like the shrinking, the anal probe thing, and buddy commands got in the way.While I didn’t get the laughs I expected, I can still appreciate this game for what it is though as a whole…A well balanced, but repetitive, rpg with a decent story to keep you moving forward..I give Southpark The Stick of Truthan 8/10",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.7,Generally favorable reviews,25.0,5.0,5.0,77.0

Spelunker World,PlayStation 4,Tozai Games,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2015-11-10,"Spelunker World will challenge you at every turn, since so many obstacles are deadly. If you persist, you'll find a rewarding experience. I've played the previous PS3 version (Spelunker HD, including the Championship difficulty DLC) a ton, and this is a worthy successor with a few flaws. If you don't know already, the point of Spelunker is that it is punishingly difficult (maybe like Super Meat Boy), so you will die a lot. You only get 2 spare lives to complete a level, but you can always quit and retry a level. Or, play cooperatively online and be rescued to get a new life. The free-to-play aspect kicks in if you choose to get a new set of lives within a level, but this is never required. You can collect equipment to make the game easier by collecting treasures. If you keep collecting the same equipment, it can be upgraded. Upgraded equipment is never required to beat an area, but is required to collect at least one treasure in most areas. Compared to the PS3 versions, Spelunker World lacks offline split-screen co-op but online gameplay seems more stable. Areas are broken into smaller sets of levels so that people can rejoin easier. Since you cannot join an online lobby when the game is in progress, I wish it had an option to spectate or wait until a game is joinable. The treasure unlocking at the end of an area could stand to be sped up. The gameplay feels a bit stiff compared to the PS3 version, but this appears to be due to a slight pause when your character changes directions, which is fine once you get used to it. ""Rope Assist"" is now on by default which feels strange. This makes the game easier by preventing you from slipping left or right off of vines, but it would be nice if there was an option to turn this off. Difficulty wise, I would say it's slightly easier than the PS3 version both due to the automatic ""Rope Assist"" and a few situations which would have resulted in death but are now safe maneuvers in Spelunker World. But on the flip side there is at least one situation that will kill you in Spelunker World that had been safe in the previous games. I highly recommend playing especially for the online co-op, which is an experience like nothing else. As long as you play patiently and smartly (and prepare to be trolled by the developers), then you'll do fine.",0,No score yet,0.0,3.0,0.0,4.5,Generally unfavorable reviews,3.0,5.0,7.0,45.0

The more RP you have, the bigger and badder your allies will be when you call them into battle. You can fight alongside these NPC reinforcements or hang back while they do the heavy lifting for you. The game also includes a random event system which keeps each fight unique as computer-controlled space pirates sweep in to win the battle for themselves in dozens of predetermined assault scenarios.

Strikers Edge,PlayStation 4,Fun Punch Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Top-Down']",T,2018-01-30,"Dodgeball is a fun game, whether you suck at it or not. There aren’t many activities in school that allow you to throw things at people with the intent of hitting them without some sort of negative consequences soon following. That means pegging Seth with that big rubber ball brings quite a sense of satisfaction and pride. So what is the best way of translating that to a video game? 1v1 or 2v2 seems to be optimal with the newest game from Fun Punch. It’s worth noting right now that Strikers Edge is a multiplayer game, much like the recent Nidhogg 2. Is there a campaign for the characters? Sure, but it’s more of a training area once you’ve completed the optional tutorial for gameplay. This is made most obvious when seeing almost all of the trophies/achievements are tied to online play. The campaign allows you to view the different stages the game has to offer and find out which character you enjoy playing the most. There are several characters to choose from, each with their own special abilities that will help or hinder your chances of winning, depending on your skills and who the other team is using. This is a game that comes off as simple at a glance, but has a lot of depth. There aren’t many buttons to know – attack, dodge, aim, move, block, and special. Two of those are the analog sticks, which leaves you with four buttons, all of which are shoulder buttons. This makes the most sense as your thumbs will be occupied at all times with moving and aiming. While the computer will likely not give you any issues (depending on the difficulty you choose), much like Smash Bros, your hardest opponents will be humans. And honestly, once you start playing it, you’ll be begging for the challenge. Admittedly, I was drawn to Strikers Edge because of its aesthetic, but it soon had its claws in me with the different play styles associated with each character. Much like a fighting game, you’ll soon find certain characters are better against others, and the varied locales bring different strategies with environmental defenses that break after a certain amount of damage. I can honestly see this becoming a huge game for streaming, and potentially even the e-sport circuit. If you’re playing on the PC, the game also includes a Twitch centered mode, which allows the community to choose what’s going to happen with the match. Certain modifiers are shown prior to it starting, and are then voted on by the community. This makes the game a more interactive experience for viewers, and also adds something new to the game for those playing. The weakest offering here is the campaign. While I appreciate the effort to provide something for those of us that aren’t huge into multiplayer games, it feels like a last minute add-on opposed to a hand crafted experience. There’s some exposition detailing what’s going on with each character, but the meat of it is the battles, and while you’ll go up against more than one opponent at a time, it never provided a sense of accomplishment. Perhaps if there was more of a reason to complete it, I’d have enjoyed it more. I also found myself waiting several minutes at a time for online matches to start up. I believe this has much more to do with the amount of people that had the game and when I was playing it than anything else. While these types of games basically live or die depending on their player base, I believe this will grow quickly once people actually see it in action. Strikers Edge seemingly came out of nowhere, and proves once again that Playdius is a publisher you need to be watching. I believe this is also Fun Punch’s debut title, and what a way to enter the game space. We’ve had a lot of great debuts recently from budding developers, but when genres you normally don’t care for are able to make you crave more from them, that’s something altogether different from the norm. Even if you only plan on playing this locally at parties or small get-togethers, it’ll make a great impression on everyone that picks up a controller and launches a spear.",66,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Sudden Strike 4: Road to Dunkirk,PlayStation 4,Kite Games,"['Strategy', 'Real-Time', 'General']",,2017-10-23,"Everyone knows the history of the evacuation of Dunkirk, if not then Google it to read all about how the ordinary man and woman raised the bar and took to the see in a daring mission, unarmed and under fire, crossed the English channel to rescue the stranded British troops in France with the brave French fighting off the German advance. Now reenact that in the excellent Sudden Strike 4 DLC pack Road To Dunkirk. We gave Sudden Strike 4 9/10 in our review. After playing more and now playing the add-on I stand buy that score. SS4 grows on you. It's challenging gameplay pushes you to think of how you'd plan things in real life situations. Go it all guns and it will end with all your units in tatters.The two allied missions have you standing up to the overpowering German advance. You now have 10 new units at your disposal but what steals the show is the navel strike you can now call in. I sat on my sofa as shells whizzed overhead from the strike and pounded the ground and German onslaught.It's quite thrilling all be it short lived. The two German missions see you attacking the French and British pushing them back into the ocean. So it really is the Allied missions that stuck out for me. The beach itself is a sight to behold. Little British troops run to the man made jetties to board the little boats as they were called. The bandstand and ferries wheel are all there to see as are small beach tent/huts. Stukas swoop down strafing the troops waiting to board boats or bomb the anti air guns. It's brilliant to see all the extra detail and hard work that has gone into the dlc. What doesn't sit right with me is the price. On PSN the dlc costs £7.99. This is a shame as yes if your keeping up there are just 4 missions, just shy of £2 per mission. BUT if you put into context the price of the main game can be bought for  £27.85 then adding that to the DLC brings a total of £35.84 and trust me that as a package you get a brilliant game worthy of the price. If you don't shop about and pay £49.99 for the game then I'd wait for a sale. Road to Dunkirk is a great addition to a brilliant game. It's a shame they just missed the boat to run the dlc with the movie that I thought was great but with those memories of the movie, and if you enjoyed the movie, you'll love the Road to Dunkirk dlc pack.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I wasn't sure I was going to keep playing.  Slowly but surely, however, I got drawn into the risk/reward loop: fighting, dying, getting a bit further on my subsequent run and spending my hard earned points for upgrades on my skill tree grew to be addictive. Plus of course finding new gear to unlock new maps, Metroidvania style. I wound up really liking Sundered, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge.  You will see your heroine, Eshe, get dragged down by tentacles (the equivalent of the 'YOU DIED' screen in Dark Souls) a lot of times, and you'll probably teach your PS4 a few words it's never heard when you finally succumb to a mob that will not stop coming, but the reward of getting a bit further and a bit stronger will keep those who like a challenge playing.",70,Mixed or average reviews,11.0,9.0,2.0,7.2,Mixed or average reviews,10.0,3.0,3.0,72.0

Super Cloudbuilt,PlayStation 4,"Coilworks, Double Eleven","['Action Adventure', 'General']",T,2017-07-25,"Disclaimer: I was a QA tester for SCB and am friends with the developers. Also, I loved the original to death and all of this colors my opinion. Super Cloudbuilt is wonderful, it is everything Cloudbuilt wanted to be polished to perfection. I put over 900 hours into the original Cloudbuilt, and while the core mechanics were phenomenal and I obviously love it it did have some obvious flaws. The story was a notable weak point and the whole game lacked a sense of polish, on top of that several of the game modes were prone to crashing and a couple of bugs with the movement simplified the game to much at the highest level. I'm happy to say that all of that has been addressed in Super Cloudbuilt The core of what made Cloudbuilt great is still here, that freedom of choice and the feeling of exploration is made all the more viceral by the redesigned levels and expansive design incorperated into every piece of the game. The movement is more refined, allowing new players to pick up the game more quickly and feel greater control over their motions. Demi feels as if she has actual weight and momentum now and the strange way Demi liked to get stuck on things in the original is gone. The story and level select have been overhauled from the ground up. The hospital hub world is compact yet full of detail and the fact that Demi's monologues can be listened to inside loading screens or as you begin a new level keeps them from breaking the flow as they did in the original. The voice acting is also much improved, as well as the writing. Finally, the polish. Everything about Super Cloudbuilt screams polish. The menus are sleek and modern, the inventory system is simple and effective, and everything is where you would expect it to be. All of this combined with a new global leaderboard system and the many gamemodes Cloudbulit has always had gives hours of content for those people who want to go fast while still providing rewards for those who want to play more casually. For me Super Cloudbuilt is a 10/10, everything about this game is an improvement upon the original and it has earned it's spot as one of my favorite games of all time.",78,Generally favorable reviews,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.6,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,1.0,3.0,56.0

Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization - Abyss of the Shrine Maiden: Chapter I,PlayStation 4,Bandai Namco Games,"['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG']",T,2017-05-16,"Abyss of the Shrine Maiden is the first part of the DLC expansion out of the three I would like to say beforehand that I actually liked SAO Hollow Realization. Though the graphics weren't the best and there was a lot of RNG (Repetitive)I thought it was a decent game and it was a big improvement to the other SAO games from before especially Hollow Fragment With that said, lets start with the DLC Review.This Dlc takes place in a volcanic/fire themed area and I personally thought it was alright. Some of the areas was better than the others for example the beginning area while some of the worser ones were the dark corridors, and volcanic labyrinths. The story for this part is essentially a big teaser to what's to come and if you've played Warriors of the sky before hand; this basically continues the search and identity of whose the masked NPC girl is.*It's obvious who it is though xD* The game play is pretty much the same with welcoming additions like the increased lvl cap and heroine quest which you do a certain task to get a cg scene and a fusion of sorts (Healer, Buffer, etc...)And also the green chests are pretty cool side thing to collect for! I also appreciate that they added voice acting! Don't know why Warriors of the Sky was left out excluding the Rain and Seven scenes ofc... Now here comes the Cons: I did not like how you can't do everything you want in the map like clearing the hardest NM's which are now at least twice the lvl you are currently... Like how are you suppose to finish them?! On top of that I really hated TWO specific Bosses in the DLC. One is a recurring one but the first time you encounter is by far the hardest and you get easily Game Over if you are not careful enoughI just hated the fact you cannot progress with the DLC unless you defeat them(Btw its possible if you are still playing that part; Just take your time and watch their movements) The Second Boss is ofc the Main Dish for this DLC... I absolutely did not enjoy this fight,  though I liked the OST and boss design.I really think it's unnecessary to add a golden chain to prevent any damage to the boss until it releases...  I think I would have enjoyed the fight a bit more if they got rid of that and speeding up the fight a lot more.... *I died to this guy once when I got it down to one health bar; I died because it randomly did his ultimate one shot kill move while it was vulnerable* ~It took me an whole hour to beat this guy with a lvl 86 character I did learn Patience though for this DLC and I can definitely prepare for it if this happens again in the next one :) So overall the big question, is it worth it?  Look if you have completed the base game and warriors of the sky, I think some parts of this dlc beats whats in the main game. So I say it's worth it for this first DLC; It may be frustrated at times but I just love the new additions and more interactions with the SAO cast especially Preimere!! Ik its a 7 but in truth its more like a 6.5. The Pros outweigh the cons and I look forward to the story picking up the pace in the next one :D Thanks for reading this review and enjoy your day!",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This game is a blast to play and genuinely gives me the feeling of playing an epic D&D; campaign. What's most puzzling is that Metacritic showered Pillars of Eternity with rave reviews and yet took a massive dump on this game. I have Pillars of Eternity and I played 16 hours into that game and got bored and frustrated from the very bland story line and constant changing cast of characters that you are forced to learn all of their abilities and control. Sword Coast, in my opinion, is an upgrade on story line over Pillars as well as overall game play. Yes, in Sword Coast you will have to control the other characters in your party but only to do simple tasks such as switching to the rogue to detect traps, secret doors and unlock chests but during battle you can feel confident just playing your own character and relying on the games AI to properly control the other characters. With Pillars I was constantly being forced to stop the game and switch from character to character to get them to do the right thing. The action is much faster in Sword Coast and feels much more fluid than Pillars. Sword Coast is an outstanding game that has been overlooked by the gaming industry. It's one of the best games I have played in recent years.",51,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,4.0,1.0,6.3,Mixed or average reviews,8.0,4.0,5.0,63.0

Tearaway Unfolded,PlayStation 4,Media Molecule,"['Action Adventure', 'Adventure', 'General', 'Fantasy']",E,2015-09-08,"Tearaway takes place in a beautiful paper-craft world.  Its a very personal journey that lets you shape the world.  Originally a Vita game, different features have been changed to reflect the features of the PS4.  Its such a seamless transition that anyone who buys the game without prior knowledge will probably never consider the fact that this is a port.  Tearaway is a long and memorable game that really gets you involved as you lose yourself in this one-of-a-kind experience. Tearaway is a shared journey between ""you"" and the messenger Iota (or Atoi).  The messager must reach the hole in the sky if he/she is to deliver his message to ""you"".  Its your job to guide the messenger on their journey.  It will be a grand adventure, one where you'll leave your mark everywhere you go.  The ability to take pictures along the way lets you catalog your experiences to reflect back on at a later time.  Use this feature to celebrate your victories as you help the different local creatures with their needs. Tearaway is a platformer with a heavy emphasis on creativity.  This becomes evident very early on as you're task with creating your own unique messenger.  You buy different objects and facial features for decorating by collecting scraps found though out the game.  You can even make your own designs which is necessary a different at key points throughout the game.  It very rewarding to see the impact your creations have on the world and its inhabitants. The gameplay is all about utilizing the features of the PS4 controller (just as the original game used the features of the Vita).  In order to navigate though this world you'll use everything from the touch pad, to the sixaxis, to specific button manipulation.  For example, the touch pad lets you draw objects and by tapping it your can help your messenger bounce around the levels.  Other than that this is pretty much a semi-tradition platformer with a heavy emphasis on story-telling. This three-dimensional platformer is quite a change of pace from Media Molecule side-scrolling Little Big Planet series.  Its amazing how well they were able to transition to a very different style of gameplay.  This is such a unique experience and its wonderfully executed.  Platforming can sometimes get a little tough, especially towards the end.  This a minor gripe in a game that is mostly pretty laid back and leaves the tougher challenges as optional quests.  It seems like every time you feel it might come to an end you're thrown back into the world with new areas to explore.  This helps make Tearaway a surprisingly long game.  This is a cute and charming adventure game that players of all ages should be able to enjoy.",81,Generally favorable reviews,58.0,12.0,0.0,8.1,Generally favorable reviews,187.0,32.0,27.0,81.0

The Bellows,PlayStation 4,Castle Steps,"['Action Adventure', 'Survival']",T,2017-07-11,"The Bellows is a PSVR horror game.  Unlike other games that call themselves horror games because they attempt to give you a creepy atmosphere and nothing else, this game actually does something with it all.  It's 30 minutes of funneling you down hallways where you're presented with room after dark room with only your trusty lamp to light the way.  There are no puzzles to solve, no exploration to do (though there is an achievement for finding the ""illusive"" Sneaky Chuck which I didn't encounter on my straightforward playthrough; I plan to go back for a second run to find him though).   No, unlike Resident Evil 7 (great game) where you have to solve puzzles to get your scares in, this game goes right for the fear from moment one, and it hits that button in every room until you're finished, or you give up (""No way I'm going in there after what I just saw!"").  The two settings, a manor and a hospital, are creepy, and there are movements of things that shouldn't move, mutant science experiments gone wrong, and doctors chasing down unwilling patients.  There are a few in-your-face jump scares, but mostly it's creepy environments, things moving in the shadows wherever you look, and sound effects when they turn out the lights.  All the best parts of horror movies. The best way to describe this game is to say it's like a haunted house.  You pay your $5, walk through a few rooms, get the crap scared out of you for a little while, and leave with a smile.  This is the horror game my wife has been waiting for since we bought a PSVR. We enjoyed it so much, we just wish there was more.

The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited - Orsinium,PlayStation 4,ZeniMax Media,"['Role-Playing', 'Massively Multiplayer']",M,2015-11-18,"For those who had fun with the main game 'Orsinium' should be very enjoyable. The story is perhaps one of the best in the game so far. It may not reach the narrative level of the TW3-dlc 'Hearts of Stone' but I found it very entertaining. Also you get a whole new area to explore but although it's big, IMO there's not that much to actually look at and explore. Fortunately there are enough quests in it to distract from that issue (it took me something like 20 hours to complete it). Plus there are quite a few nice little puzzles this time so the gameplay doesn't get boring too fast. And the lore is pretty interesting this time. If your character isn't strong enough yet for this DLC, he/she gets an upgrade whenever you are in this area. So everybody has a fair chance. I only used a bow (vereran 5) and most of the time it went fine. A few fights were challenging for me but it should be no problem to do this as single player experience. Overall: surprisingly good dlc although the new area looks a bit boring. I would give 'Orsinium' a 77%.",72,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,5.1,Mixed or average reviews,8.0,0.0,7.0,51.0

The Escapists 2,PlayStation 4,Mouldy Toof Studios,"['Action', 'General']",T,2017-08-22,"If there’s one thing that is used as a level in games more often than not, it’s being locked up in a jail of some sort. Whether it be the start to a game (Elder Scrolls), or a strategy to take everything away and create a type of escape/stealth mission where you must not only escape your cell, but also must reacquire your gear, it’s a common trope you’ve no doubt seen in video games. One of the reasons this is used over and over is because it’s a fun change from the rest of the game, and an easy way to switch things up. But what if you were tasked with escaping from multiple prison cells as an entire game? The Escapists 2 expands on the gameplay and options provided in the first entry, while adding a lot of content and features. On top of a more polished game, you’ll be tasked with escaping moving prisons and having the option of doing so along other players. The latter of these two options was especially important to me, as my wife and I are always looking for something to play together, and it seems most games don’t offer the option anymore. This not only allows for local co-op, but online co-op and versus modes. Will you work together to escape the prison, or will you use the other for personal gain and leave them in prison? In versus you will be competing against the clock to escape the fastest, while there isn’t really a time limit with the co-op. All the local modes involve a split screen down the middle, and four squares if you’re popular enough to have three friends. For those unfamiliar with The Escapists, this offers a tutorial prison in which everything is told in the form a flashback from the comfort of a beach. It teaches you the basics of what to expect in the actual game, but there’s still a lot that you likely won’t pick up from completing that alone. As you explore the first real level by yourself, you’ll come to understand the game proper. You’ll do favors for other inmates, which will earn you money that you can use to pay for items, purchase hints, and use for bribes. I didn’t find every facet the game has to offer, and I’m 99% certain all of the escapes have single player ways of approaching them, but it was a great addition to the game having to work together to get into certain areas. Simply teaming up to build certain items for your daunting task is exceedingly fun – especially when you’re playing together in the same room and can communicate directly. The game also offers emotes with the D-Pad, letting you communicate online for those that don’t have two systems set up next to each other. However, playing online also means doing so with someone that may not be as friendly, and end up using you to get away. It’s a gamble you’ll face while playing online – albeit a fun one. Do you take the quick civilian route, perform the classic dig, pummel your way to victory, or follow some other means that may remind you of Metal Gear? These are only a handful of the escapes you’ll discover in your time prison-hopping. How do you choose to escape a moving train? Can you simply walk into space and be done with it? The previous entry was a sandbox as well, but this adds so much to the table. If you’re new to the series, it’s important to know that the game doesn’t wait on your every whim. Far from it, as you are in a prison full of routine. Miss something like lunch or exercise time, and your heat goes up. Get in a fight; expect to be put down quickly, by guards or the inmate you decided to give a wallop. If the place goes into lock-down, expect to get knocked out and wake up to peeling potatoes, along with losing all of your gear you spent so much time collecting and crafting. While you have a stash in your cell, it can be raided at any point, so you will want to hide your most valuable items in the secret compartment you are provided. What is at first a very minimalist character creator soon becomes a robust creation tool as you unlock new options through gameplay. The graphics got a bit of an update, so it certainly looks nicer. The prisons have many layers to explore, opposed to just one or two levels. It also features leaderboards for each level, with filters for everyone that plays the game, yourself, and friends you know – additionally, you can see whether they were playing Singleplayer, Multiplayer, or Versus. The Escapists 2 has this draw for success, despite likely involving lots of failure your first or fifth time through. I found myself telling my wife how we’d be breaking out of jail while eating, showering, and while she was sleeping. With multiple escapes to accomplish, competitive multiplayer, leaderboards, and co-op jailbreaks, it’s hard to not love everything this game has to offer. The dialogue can be completely overlooked, but you’d be missing out on a lot of great humor. This entry takes the original and puts it in overdrive, and it’s everything you could want from it.",76,Generally favorable reviews,21.0,8.0,0.0,7.0,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,1.0,2.0,70.0

It lacks horrible microscopic writings/letters in general and the mini-crafting of health packages or amo always drove me made, as the highlighting of positions where you actually are in the menue is so idiotic minimalistic, that I often ended up choosing the wrong option! Minimalistic is the word for the game, as the gameplay pretty soon gets very repetitive and even I really liked the pixel art style, it is just not enough flesh to keep it interesting - the music as well. Rarely there is some sound or background music, although when it comes in, it's pretty good! So I went through way too many 'stations', doing always the same while the story tries to unfold. Unfortunately your passengers on the train talk allot regarding story, but you won't be able to follow as you have to do mini-games, craft stuff or read other messages simultaneously. So, in the end and as much as I Iike the game in general, it is not worth 15 $/€ but should be around 5 $/€.

There's barely any interaction at all and all you do is shake your glowsticks in a crowd cheering at the girls. Another problem is that there's only 3 songs, with the others (I think there's 3-5 other songs) as DLCs. The only thing the game gets it right are the visuals and the girl designs. But even then, is not like we know a lot about these girls. And seriously, of all the Idolm@ster console games they could have localized (Platinum Stars for example), is the VR tech demo that gets localized? Atleast with Miku Hatsune VR, it doesn't matter if it was an average VR game. Atleast you can interact with Miku a bit. And hey, we still got the Project Diva games, so it doesn't matter if the VR game left a sour impression.

The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 2: Give No Shelter,PlayStation 4,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', '3D', 'Third-Person']",M,2016-03-29,"Dark choices and brutality await players in this second episode. There's certainly a lot happening. However the need to cram so much into the short running time, not just for this episode, but for the miniseries as whole leads to some shortcomings. Thankfully these shortcomings don't diminish my enthusiasm for this episode or the following one. The decision making is really a big hook for this episode. Usually in games like these I might struggle for a bit in making a decision, but I always find that I picked the one that felt right to me. The one that worked out in my favor and whatnot. I can't really say that here. Two big choices in this episode left me wondering if I picked the best option and had me more curious than ever to figure out what I missed. To make things better I really won't get see any of the effects from these decisions until the next episode. That's a really impressive move in my opinion. Not only does that give the decisions more weight, but it makes the wait for the next episode almost unbearable. I'm already wanting to reply the episode just to see those different choices. The short runtime makes it easy to do so. As for the story itself, it doesn't make much forward progress. The mystery surrounding Michonne's children deepens and the intensity continues to grow in the face of impending danger, but outside of two powerful choices there isn't really much going on. It's impossible to care for the new characters as there isn't enough time from them to do anything, much less have us learn anything about them that would cause us to form attachments. As far as the gameplay goes, we get a bunch of fun quick-time events. These moments are action packed and satisfyingly gory. It's a violent episode to say the least and it's a lot of fun to take part in all of this action. I have to admit I am a little worried about the future of this miniseries. There's only one episode left and Telltale has a lot of work to do in order for it to be a satisfying conclusion. A big part of the next episode is going to center around keeping the new characters alive. If past Telltale games are any indication, we aren't going to be able to save everyone. The problem is considering that there isn't any time to care about these characters the question remains; how are we supposed to care about their deaths? Also, how is taking down Norma going to be satisfying given that we've barely seen her do anything that makes here a legit villain? Everything so far just makes all of this seem like a case of a conflict arising because two groups ran into each other at the wrong time. Maybe that's the point, but one can't help but wonder whether or not that will be the miniseries downfall in the end. Even though it brings the miniseries' future into question, I have to say this is still a very entertaining episode. It might not do a great job of moving things forward, but some incredible choices and the overall dark and brutal nature of the episode kept me entertained. There's no guarantee that this is all going to go out on a high-note, but I'm still very satisfied with the is penultimate episode.

The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Episode 3: Above the Law,PlayStation 4,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",M,2017-03-28,"So this is a game about a story that is impacted by your choices. Or at least it's supposed to be, right? You'd be wrong, and here's why: Throughout this episode, the game forces on you this made-up relationship between you and your sister-in-law, Kate, with everyone telling you or implying that they thought you were hooking up with her. And she herself comes on to you soooo strong. All of this even if you make every possible choice to deny having any relationship with her throughout the entire game thus far. It's maddening. Why give me these conversation choices just to completely render them irrelevant? If Telltale really wants that to be part of the story, then they shouldn't have even given us options to try and push for that to NOT be part of the story. I don't want anything to do with Kate. Period. The next issue I have has to do with the contrivances of the writing. In this episode, problems could be solved with another sentence or two being spoken. Instead, characters stay silent. Specifically I'm talking about Javier talking to the leaders in the church about the events leading up to this episode. You, once again, are denied choices. In this case, it's the choice to fully explain yourself and what occurred before-hand. The writing does this because, logically, if he explained himself, the leadership would understand and the game wouldn't progress. So the only ways to force progression are to make the leadership illogical in their actions OR, the choice they went with, force the player-character to keep silent on these issues, even though a few words spoken could save everyone in the game the entirety of the conflict. If this wasn't a game driven PURELY by it's story, it could get away with it, but this is a game that is based entirely around it's writing and characters to carry it. Lastly, the wait between episodes was far too long. I found myself having difficulty remembering all the events of the prior two episodes and, because of this, it becomes nigh impossible to care or become invested in the story and characters. The argument could be that I should have just waited for the game to come out in its entirety, but that defeats the entire purpose of episodic content. A good episodic game allows you to discuss the game with others, get invested in the characters, make predictions about what is going to come next, etc. ""Lost"" for example, was a TV show built on this concept with people constantly discussing the show and making predictions between episodes that kept it fun and exciting even outside of watching the show.  A good episodic game should build up between episodes , getting the player excited to see what's next with the next episode releasing at the peak of excitement. When the wait is too long, the hype builds up and then crumbles, leaving nothing but apathy in its wake. My emotions during this episode ranged from apathy at the events and characters to anger at the forced relationship with Kate that I made very clear through my choices I didn't want. I felt no excitement, no fear, no shock, nothing. The 3/10 I'm giving this game is generous considering its shortcomings.",69,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,6.0,0.0,4.5,Generally unfavorable reviews,7.0,6.0,12.0,45.0

Through this you can see Clem through Gabe. The game has left too much for people to desire so I think that there will be another season based on this storyline in the future with Javier, Gabe and Clementine involved. I'd recommend this game to a player who wants to sink their teeth in to a juicy game series... But if you're new to TWD I'd reccommend you watch season 1 and 2 at the very least or even play them if you have the time so you have an understanding of what's gone down so far.",71,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,2.0,0.0,5.5,Mixed or average reviews,12.0,4.0,11.0,55.0

Because all I wanted out of this game was choices that matter like in Beyond or Heavy Rain. Choices that can alter the way the game goes. And this game, like all other telltale games turned out to be a complete hoax. They tell you that you choices matter, but in the end it all comes down to one preset ending. And no matter what you do you cant save this person you really wanted to save. Its like watching a movie, just sometimes they let you do a little walking around or a little cut-scene action, like clicking some buttons while the cutscene is being displayed.  But really, whats the point of playing a game like this, and paying for it, when there are games like Detroit : Become Human, or many others already out. And they offer a real sense of choice.

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The game plays much like Diablo, as it a top-down action RPG with a loot/reward system. The fighting mechanics can gt a bit repetitive later on, but the game's fun exploration and extra quests make it an overall enjoyable experience. The humor is especially funny, but dark. Honestly, I wonder how this didn't get an ""M"" rating. Within 2 hours, I heard the ""F"" and ""S"" word at least 15 times each. There are also a lot of sexual jokes and remarks. Point is, if you are not a fan of dark, crude humor, this isn't for you. I for one, found it to be really funny and overall the game is a nice hidden gem for PS4 owners.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition,PlayStation 4,CD Projekt Red Studio,"['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG']",M,2016-08-30,"This is probably the best money I've ever spent on a video game. I passed on the Witcher 3 when first released, so I feel I got more than my money's worth here by far. All the DLC First off, I'm not really a graphics snob and usually don't care much for that as long as the game design is good. However, this game simply blew me away. The level of detail in the world is astounding. I can only imagine how awesome this looks on a fast PC. This is simply the best looking game I've ever seen and I've played a hell of a lot of games. The attention to detail in the world building is top notch as well. I keep noticing little things here and there that just add so much life to the world. It's amazing from a visual standpoint. Like Skyrim times 10. It wouldn't mean much though if the gameplay wasn't great, but here too the developers knocked it out of the park. It's fluid and fun with a lot of little nuances. Magic and melee and ranged combat all intertwine effortlessy and there are many crafting options to enhance your weapons and abilities. This is an RPG at heart and so you expect to see some kind of upgrade path. It's quite robust and the abilities you can earn are plentiful. I spent many a painstaking moment trying to decide if I want that damage boost or if I should pump up my magic. The possibilities are endless and you can really tailor the character to your prefered style. Story. Well it's simply the best game storytelling wise I've ever played. Nuff said. I think this game is nearly perfect and you just don't see this type of product any more from a lot of the big name developers. A single player game that is complete and offers 200 hours or more of gameplay, amazing graphics, superb main story and side quests that matter. Polished to a perfect sheen. If you haven't played it, I recommend getting it right away. I don't really like giving out 10/10 perfect scores, but this game is worth it. I hope these developers continue in this fashion and can't wait to see their next game.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.1,Universal acclaim,102.0,2.0,7.0,91.0

It feels like the game only needed one character but uses multiple characters instead. That isn't bad though it just felt unnecessary.

Why am I not surprised...? Anyway, this game is a good, fun multiplayer experience in the vein of Senko no Ronde starring the cast of the Touhou  Franchise.  The goal is to use danmaku to outmanuver and box in your opponent to whittle away their life bar.  You can use Spellcards to act as a 'Boss Character' to force your opponent on the defensive.  Every character has unique properties, like Reimu's smaller hitbox or Utsuho's shots covering more screen real estate. The game includes a story mode and an Arcade Survival Mode where you face random opponents, as well as a Boss Survival Mode where you have to survive against spellcards for single player content.  Although singleplayer is bare-bones, where the game truly shines is multiplayer.  While the servers had issues on day one,  human opponents are smarter than the AI, and even then, a high level AI is brutal and fun to fight. As far as visuals go, they're what you'd expect from a doujin developer worth their salt.  The visuals are beautiful for what the devs could pull off, and the artwork is very nice.  While occasionally you will get lost when a melee attack is performed, characters rarely get lost in the hail of danmaku.  There are only a handful of stages, but aside from the grid, they all look very nice and true to their locations in the canon games. Finally, and an important note, the dialogue in story mode is amusing, even if it leans a little too close to Touhou fanon for my tastes.  Story Mode is very lighthearted and a good way to kill an evening.  In all, this is what a fan game should be:  A love letter to the fandom. The game has it's share of flaws, mostly being the servers on launch day being a little buggy in some cases.  Also, you cannot just pick up and play this game.  You will need the tutorial if you don't want your rear handed to you on a silver platter. This game gets a 9/10.  I would have given it a more fair score, but considering my contemporaries, I felt that the game needed a kinder review to begin with.  At worst, it's an 8/10, and worth your time if you want a good multiplayer experience and am a Touhou fan.",55,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,11.0,6.0,5.1,Mixed or average reviews,14.0,6.0,14.0,51.0

Tour de France 2017,PlayStation 4,Cyanide Studios,"['Sports', 'Individual', 'Biking']",E,2017-06-16,"This is a very difficult game for me to review knowing nothing of the sport. I was in Couze-et-Saint-Front near Bergerac in France on holiday and witnessed the actual race first hand this summer. Anyone who has seen the race will know that the build up and party is what it's all about as the race itself will be gone in less than 20 seconds, 60 if you want to see the cars speed past afterwards. The game is more of a time consuming beast. The game is VERY deep and purists will love it. I couldn't help be amazed at the amount of bikes on screen and how deep the gameplay can be when you delve into all the options on hand during a race. I'm playing on a PS4 Pro and the game engine does take a little hit now and then but this is very small, all be it quite often. The graphics are not that bad considering this is made by a smaller developer but it's not mapped on real world areas in the game. They are just in name only and a fly-by giving you a run down on each stage is all you get. It's put together nicely enough but don't expect to see your house while taking in the city or countryside on your bike. You can choose your team, create your own set-up and change the riders names for that more personal touch. I really can't get bogged down in all the ins and outs of the gameplay, it really is quite deep and going flat out will just result in an epic fail. Choose your time to sprint and consume energy is the name of the game and hope to strike at the right time. You drink water etc to pace yourself, it's all the real deal. A full tutorial is the first place to head after booting up. You really need to complete this before starting a race. For anyone that's impatient you can zoom through the race and change the riders strategy to pace themselves or go all out on attack. Be warned though, zooming to far can result in your team loosing the stage so careful planning is key. Enthusiasts of the real tour are going to love this. Anyone else will enjoy it but it will purely come down to the individual player as to how long a play time they will give this. Hats off to the developer, they have made these games for years and you can tell the love for the sport.

Trulon was developed by KYY Games and published by Head Up Games. You start the game as a young monster hunter named Gladia who has been sent on a quest by the mayor to find the source of the mysterious disease that is afflicting the land. Once outside the city, the open world allows you the option to encounter monsters and treasures, instead of throwing you in battle, as you make your way towards your next destination. The card-based battle system is also turn-based making it a very laid back RPG to play.There are four playable characters, Each with their own playing styles and strengths.The artwork is simple yet colorful making it easily my favorite part of this game. Overall I think Trulon is the perfect introduction RPG for those who have not tried them yet, or for those that want to play a simple slow paced game.  I give Trulon a 6/10 review score.

Its gotten a lot of hate from trailers over bad animations and boring gameplay. I've played for about 30 minutes now and I have a few things to say that are good, and a few things that are bad. Pros - Customization is very well done, graphics look good, maps are redone nicely and look great, fast gameplay on the multimission maps makes it seems pretty forgiving when you die to something stupid, lastly the game runs not terribly and I can keep 60fps with an R9 290 and FX 8320 despite it being an Nvidia title. Cons - Mouse control is completely terrible and there is no setting to change zoomed aim in the game, you can really tell that the game was made for a controller which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, the zombies feel like cardboard when you shoot them which also sucks but they arent a main objective in the PVP modes anyways so it wont bother you much, last con I had was that it took me 10 minutes of going into lobbies and being kicked before I finally got in a game. All in all I think that they will fix a bunch of the network errors and hopefully a mod or something comes out that can fix the mouse, if these 2 things were fixed I'd say the game is easily worth $30 even as an RE COD its still pretty fun and will keep me entertained for a while.",38,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,12.0,43.0,2.5,Generally unfavorable reviews,24.0,8.0,125.0,25.0

How does that work? Well allow me to explain.Your box character might be a box, but it has full 360 rotation allowing you to move around with ease.You have 2 moves you can use, Slam and Unbox. Slam is used to knock out and destroy enemies while Unbox is a unique mechanic designed specifically to help you get around. You see, your box character is actually made of many boxes inside each other, and each unbox gives you a huge jump boost but also uses one of these boxes inside you which act as your health. This jump boost mechanic allows you to traverse huge distances really quickly, which is needed to get around the extemely large worlds. Speaking of the worlds...There are 3 major worlds and a hub world in this game, technically making 4 areas in total.The hub world only has the collectables in it whereas the 3 major worlds all have mission and secrets aswell. Each world is it's own huge open area with tons of NPC's, missions, collectables and secrets that all ofer something unique and fun. Exploring them is an absolute treat and I only wish there were more. All in all I think Unbox: Newbie's Adventure is a wonderful addition to the growing list of 3D platformer releases this year.

Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth,PlayStation 4,Aqua Plus,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'General']",M,2017-09-05,"If you are playing Mask of Truth, it is probably because you were entranced by Mask of Deception, and I can honestly say to anyone on the fence: do it. If you dont like Slice of life fr the first half, watch the anime, itll be quicker, but for those looking for almost 100 hours of living in another world, feeling the whole story, and having the cathartic feeling when it ends, I recommend the whole series. I hate visual novels. I dont like reading my video games, and you dont really rate the novel on its gameplay, because it is focusing more on telling a story. I picked up Mask of Deception because it was sold to me as an SRPG. I played it and got tired of it for a while, on a whim I picked it up, and Once i finished the first few battles, I fell in love with the cast, the characters, the story, the music, the whole damn thing. It was such a fresh experience. Even the beginning which is almost all slice of life, felt engaging. The music and the writing really made you feel like you were there. When the story finally picks up though, you feel the rush coming, when the climax is at the peak, it leaves you wanting more, and that is where Mask of Truth picks up. It maintains the same music, and style of writing, which is perfect, but more of the story is shown, and It has all sorts of plot twist and turns, and each character death really made me feel something, whether it was a guy I hated, or someone i loved. I teared up multiple times during this game. Suara, (the singer of most of the vocals) does a great job on these games, in fact she also did the songs for the Anime as well. I highly recommend anyone who likes a fantasy style atmosphere in their anime. If you are playing this just for the SRPG elements, I would say shy away from it unless you love a good story, the battles are few and far between, but I didnt play Mask of Truth for the gameplay, I wanted to finish the story, and as this is the onyl way to see the sequel in a non manga form, I gladly shelled out the money to finish my story with Haku and Kuon. I honestly feel empty and happy at the same time, It is one of those games that you want to forget so you can do it all again. It reminds us of why we are only human, and that nothing is perfect.",74,Mixed or average reviews,10.0,11.0,0.0,7.3,Mixed or average reviews,13.0,0.0,4.0,73.0

It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition. Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability.

We Are The Dwarves,PlayStation 4,Whale Rock Games,"['Strategy', 'Real-Time', 'General']",T,2017-03-21,"Summary: DO NOT BUY! Long version: Played this game as local co-op. The graphics are quite mediocre, but I thought I would be able to forgive that if the story and gameplay were good. THEY WERE NOT. At first my gf and I were laughing in disbelief when one of the dwarves got stuck in a cave after we had been playing only for 2 minutes. We had to restart and were able get to the 2nd area. The controls are really clunky; the game is somewhat similar to an RTS in that there's some delay between issuing a command and when the attack takes place. In a game where you control one dwarf at a time (unlike an actual RTS where you have several units), it is a really bad idea and EVEN MORE terribly executed. Controlling the dwarf and selecting targets is awkward. It makes the gameplay REALLY terrible. (I'm guessing the PC version lets one player control all three of them.) The sound effects are repetitive and like everything else, of low quality. We tried, REALLY tried to enjoy the game but soon the laughter turned into frustration as I realized that not only did I waste a few hours loading the game and then trying to play it, I also actually PAID for that awful piece of ****. Do not buy this game. Let me reiterate: No matter how much you like dwarves, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0

Werewolves Within,PlayStation 4,Ubisoft,"['Miscellaneous', 'Party / Minigame']",E,2016-12-06,"It's an absolute travesty that this game has received anything less than a 9 from both critics and users and I implore everyone with any VR system to buy it and try it. I downloaded this game due to it being one of only a few PSVR games I hadn't yet played. My expectations were pretty low and, in a general sense, I hate online multiplayer games. Within an hour of playing, Werewolves Within became my favorite VR game for any headset, and as someone who worked in the VR industry I've played nearly all of them. Not only that, but without any hyperbole at all, I can say this will go down as one of my favorite video game experiences in the 30 years I've been a hardcore player. The gameplay is dead simple as the only mechanic is talking. The rules appear complex at first but are really very easy to understand after a few matches. Fundamentally, this is a game of sitting around a campfire building alliances, and deceiving others. Lots and lots of deception. If you've ever dreamed of being a trial attorney, this is as close as you're going to get without passing the bar. You're either a werewolf or not and regardless of your game assigned role, it's up to you to convince others you're on their team. A match lasts about 10 minutes. For the most part, everyone is civil and attempting to play the game in earnest. When you get a great group, you'll spend hours with them and make some great online friends. There are a few things to be aware of, however. Just like IRL, there is an absurdly high chance that many of the people sitting around a campfire and arguing about who is a werewolf are stoned and/or drunk (myself included). It's utterly hilarious but it can quickly get out of control (usually the drunk ones, but you can vote to kick them). There aren't many bugs or flaws but there are a few things to be aware of for parents. While this seems like a general audience game and good for children, it's a double edged sword. On one hand I really think it can help with social interactions and anxiety and, for a video game, is a safe and somewhat less wasteful way to spend time. On the other hand, the aforementioned drunk players will often use bad language and inappropriate slurs the like of which you'd hear in a move rated R. Additionally, you really need to be comfortable with your children playing a game exclusively about lying and deception. If I had kids over the age of 12, I'd let them play but not without a serious discussion beforehand and a promise that they would leave any group of ""bad people"". As someone who values intellect, group leadership and strong interpersonal bonds above most else, I find this ""game"" nothing short of a revelation that will stick with me for decades. This really does represent a defining moment in technology and digital human interaction while being the most fun you can have on a Saturday night. Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit for bankrolling such an innovation and Red Storm just became my favorite developer of 2017. The team at Red Storm is extraordinary and I hope to meet them one day soon. You owe it to yourself to buy and play this game, it's more fun than you've probably ever had playing a game and you'll be a part of something that is destined to become a historic milestone in the advancement of technology.

White Noise 2,PlayStation 4,Milkstone Studios,"['Action Adventure', 'Survival']",M,2017-10-13,"White Noise 2Decently Fun but extremely unbalancedWhite Noise 2 is a 4 v 1 survival game where you play as either an investigator or a monster…as an investigator your job is to find all 8 clue around the map, from tapes, to chests, to close a portal and end a match..Every character has their own stats and more are unlocked as you level up...investigators have a flash light, the ability to yell to tell other players where they are, the ability to throw glow sticks to slow the monster down.. And they have a compass to point them in the direction of the nearest clue…And as the monster your goal is to kill every player before they can find all clues…There are a variety of monsters for different play styles with their own abilities like teleporting behind the nearest investigator, turning off their lights, or teleporting to the nearest secret for example… though all have a compass pointing to the nearest investigator..However this game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the monster…There wasn’t 1 match I played where the investigators won…as an investigator you have to deal with conserving batteries despite enemies being able to detect you better when your light is on… this is balance enough.. having to manage a battery is unnecessary…flashlights are annoying but not over powered… as again monsters can choose their respawn points if you force a teleport on them with your light, one of them is unaffected if they stay still.. You can force them to go out… it’s just unfairThe compass on the investigator side only gives you a direction for a couple seconds and disappears and takes forever to cool down...I get it that you have 4 players so you can take turns with the compass, but it’s hard to communicate a plan without a mic,I don’t think the compass should be unlimited, but at the very least the cool down should be cut in half especially if you’re asking them to manage their batteries…The monster also has to ability to summon idols to go off when characters are near a location as if their compass wasn’t enough.. And these idols can make the investigator lose their sanity and go crazy...You can save people from the monster if they’re caught... but after the first investigator is killed, every kill after is basically an instakill… giving you no chance to save your partner… but this ridiculous unbalance forces players to stick together, you can’t split up and collect clues, because one death essentially sabotages the rest of the team…Once you are dead you’re still in the game as a ghost..and as a ghost you can still communicate and you have flame to help players escape the monster and guide them to the nearest clue as you can see the map much better than them…but it just isn’t enough to even the playing field…Don’t get me wrong… I enjoyed trying to win as the investigator side...it just feels so impossible…The most fun is being the monster and using your abilities and listening to people trash talk you while you hunt them down…but being the monster is so easy that at times I felt bad for the other team…White Noise 2 is a cool concept..

When you hear it the 2nd time you know you survived and a new hour starts with a new set of rules... but unfortunately in the same map…My biggest issue with this game and this genre of survival horror is that it’s all for the most part luck based... you have a fraction of a second to react to a random spawn or be forced to restart…Constant deaths to random spawns sometimes unfairly when you’re in a certain building so there’s no way of escape feels cheap, and ultimately makes the ghost children feel like annoying gimmicks rather than terrors to deal with…That’s not to say I didn’t get scared… As there’s are plenty of jump scare moments… but really only jump scare moments... the environment isn’t really all to unsettling, especially since the map doesn’t change you get used to it fairly quickly…I feel like each hour taking place in a new area of the forest could’ve greatly helped it, and maybe a little more forgiveness and allow a slightly larger window to react to enemy attacks…Wick will definitely get your heart racing…But ultimately ends up being frustrating rather than a terrifying and addictive time…I give wick, a 5/10",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.8,Generally unfavorable reviews,1.0,1.0,2.0,48.0

It covers a decent amount of that show, but not as much as I had hoped (the Noah arc isn't there at all, and I think there's a bunch of other stuff missing too). That said, most of the battles you care about are there from the beginning of the show up through the Battle City season.

No rhyme or reason to the skillshot, rule set seems complicated, and the setup of the table is weak. Aforementioned skillshot is more luck than skill, Archer's car placed near the front of the play field largely gets in the way. Only 1 upper playfield flipper adds little, mini games are dull. The other 1 I had so much hope for, Bob's Burgers, was less of a letdown but still not great. Playfield is mostly ramps, again skill shot makes no sense, mini games mostly involve spamming ramp shots. 1 upper playfield flipper I have still never gotten to use in about 20 plays. Family Guy was a pleasant surprise- right from start with skill shot and Joe Swanson plunger. Varied play field creates good mix of ramps and targets to aim for. Mini games like ""Peter vs. the Chicken"" are fun and the right level of difficult. Enjoy the special balls for the game's characters- nice mix up of characters using the major (Griffins, Quagmire) and minor ones (Herbert, Mayor West) alike. The best table, perhaps surprisingly due to it probably being the least popular show, was American Dad. Creative use of all the characters with mini games and targets (such as Klaus' fishbowl) and running bits from the show, such as ""Wheels and the Legman"" and Steve and Snot's air guitar. Most varied play field of the 4, mostly enjoyable multiball action as well.

8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume One,Xbox One,Abstraction Games,"['Miscellaneous', 'Compilation']",E,2017-10-31,"I love when these classic games are brought back to life, and when done correctly they deliver a number of nostalgic moments. Thankfully 8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume One has been done correctly and each different game that’s been ported plays just like the original so there’s buckets of nostalgia present throughout. I forgot how good the stories were in game’s like this and it’s a nice pleasant reminder because each story is interesting and keeps you hooked throughout. The puzzles in the game have aged really well and if you love puzzles that offer you a challenge and require some thought then you will love this anthology. I will say though that the cursor in the game can be frustrating when trying to complete the puzzles, and that’s mainly down to how slow it moves and in my opinion they could have provided you with an option of speeding the cursor up. They have maintained each game as close to the original as they can and in my opinion this will put some gamers off, and a few slight tweaks here and there would have definitely made the game more accessible to different gamers. I will say though that they’ve got the price spot on and it doesn’t cost you a lot to take a trip down memory lane, which is great. The presentation side of the game is perfect and I’m glad they never changed anything here. Visually the 8-Bit art style has never looked better and the accompanying sound design stirs up a lot of fond memories, which is awesome.

911 Operator,Xbox One,Code Horizon,"['Simulation', 'Virtual', 'Career']",T,2017-11-08,"911 Operator is definitely a unique addition to the Xbox One, and the best thing is that the core idea they’ve implemented works very well and it does a great job of keeping you invested throughout. One of the things I really liked about the game is that it allows you to use the map of where you live, and in my opinion this personal touch makes the game stand out quite a bit. Another thing the game does really well is that it has a great variation of unique calls, and some of these calls can be pretty emotional. Whilst the variation in the calls is great I would have liked them to have included more calls, which in turn would have stopped it from becoming repetetive. Even though it becomes repetetive you will still however sink a great deal of hours into the game, and the replay value is definitely high. The replay value is made even higher by the fact that you can play the game in three difficulty settings, and the three difficulty settings also makes the game more accessible to different gamers. My biggest problem with the game was that the text on screen is a little too small at times and this did cause me to make a few mistakes, which was frustrating. Thankfully though the simple methods allow you to get back on track quickly. There isn’t much to say when it comes to the presentation side of the game, and that isn’t a bad thing because this game isn’t about fantastic visuals. I will say however that the sound design has been done well, which is good. At the end of the day 911 Operator surprised me a great deal and the best thing is that it surprised me in a good way. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the game and I didn’t expect the amount of depth the game would have. Don’t get me wrong the game isn’t perfect and it does have a few problems, but these problems are easily forgotten because the game has a lot of plus points. If you like playing something different and enjoyable then I thoroughly recommend that you give 911 Operator a try.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0

Thankfully 99Vidas does have some good points and it does have a few nostalgic moments here and there, which is great. The game shines its brightest when played with friends and I must admit that when I played it with friends we all had an incredible amount of fun. When played on your own it can be fun at times, but unfortunately the steep difficulty curve when played alone can be very frustrating and annoying. What the game does really well is that it keeps the gameplay very simple and this easy pick up and play style makes the game perfect to revisit every now and then. I just wish that the campaign was a little longer because as soon as you get into it the game comes to an end, which is a shame. I will say though that each level has been done really well and they have also implemented a lot of upgrades for you to unlock. These upgrades are actually pretty decent and they do a great job of being satisfying and rewarding when used. They don’t however feel satisfying when used against the bosses because no matter what you do you just can’t shake off the generic feel of the bosses. The presentation side of the game is packed full of nostalgic moments, and I was a big fan of the presentation. The pixel art style has been done really well and the accompanying music takes you back to your youth, which is awesome. At the end of the day fans of classic brawlers will fall in love with 99Vidas almost immediately because it does the basics extremely well. It does have a few problems here and there and it may lack when it comes to innovation, but when played with friends you take part in an enjoyable adventure that’s packed full of nostalgia and for that reason it gets a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,1.0,2.0,0.0,9.0,Universal acclaim,5.0,0.0,0.0,90.0

AER: Memories of Old,Xbox One,Daedalic Entertainment,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",E10+,2017-10-25,"When I first saw a screenshot I must admit that AER: Memories of Old intrigued me somewhat, and when I first started playing the game it provided me with a relaxing and somewhat unique experience, but unfortunately as you progress you realise there isn’t much to the game. The world in which the game takes place in is in my opinion the biggest problem with the game. I say this because the world just feels empty and I was hoping for more interaction. The game does however get quite a bit right and my favourite element of the game was definitely the flying aspect. The flying has been done really well and it actually makes the exploring fun and relaxing at the same time, which is great. The puzzles in the game have also been done really well and there is decent mixture of puzzles, which keeps things interesting. It’s a shame though that the story doesn’t keep things interesting. There is nothing memorable in the story and in the end you are just left with a bland tale that does little to excite you. Most of the mechanics in the game hold up pretty well, and I was especially impressed with the controls in the game because they remained fluid and responsive throughout. The camera though wasn’t done as well and the awkwardness of it did frustrate me from time to time. The presentation side of the game is wonderful in my opinion. Visually the game can look really beautiful at times and they really have a relaxing side to them which means you end up becoming immersed in the game. At the end of the day AER: Memories of Old is ultimately an exploring game and it does provide you with some enjoyable moments, but in the end it just feels like it’s missing something. When the game does get a little exciting it’s over before its begun because the game is definitely on the short side, and the worst thing is that it doesn’t really have any replay value. I did however have more enjoyable moments than bad moments with the game, but I would wait for a price drop before fully recommending it to you.",75,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,3.0,0.0,7.2,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,3.0,2.0,72.0

It’s core idea is simple but effective at the same time, and whilst it gets a few things wrong on the whole I mainly enjoyed my time with the game. There is quite a lot of content in the game and a number of levels for you to play, and the best thing is that each level has a decent amount of variety going for it. I was also very impressed with the multiplayer in the game, and I must admit that me and my friends had a lot of fun here and in my opinion this is the best way to enjoy the game. I say this because when played alone things start to get repetetive quite quickly so you do end up becoming bored. If you don’t like a challenge from game’s then you will definitely dislike some of the levels here because in my opinion some of the levels can be way too challenging at times. Thankfully though the game has fluid and responsive controls, so if you a fail a level then it will be your fault and not the game’s fault. Most of the levels are quite memorable, but unfortunately when it came to the bosses I was a little underwhelmed which was a shame. The presentation side of the game is simple in design but in my opinion this simplicity works really well. I was especially fond of the visuals in the game and at times they definitely had a unique feel to them, which is great. At the end of the day I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from Akuatica: Turtle Racing, but thankfully what I got most of the time was an enjoyable experience.

Akuatica: Turtle Racing isn’t going to win any awards but it offers you a fun and challenging adventure especially when played with friends, so it gets a thumbs up from me.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Albert & Otto: The Adventure Begins,Xbox One,Digerati,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E10+,2018-01-10,"Platforming, Puzzles, Black and White Palette; We're not talking about Playdead's 2011 “Limbo” Albert and Otto has more than one story to tell. The game originally did not make its goal on Kickstarter, yet the developers continued and were still able to deliver a great game to PC. After a year finally released to the Xbox One and ready to be appreciated by the community. I felt the game was visually appealing, easy to read, and provides a unique take on depth of 2D-Art by using fewer colors to relay so much more. Set in a world inspired by Germany 1939, you are Albert, a boy lightly equipped on his adventure to find his lost sister. The game boasts 2 to 3 hours of puzzles, but as the difficulty rises with the game, maybe some of those puzzles took me longer than the game expected. But I celebrated even greater when I would get it right!After a few jump puzzles and narrative discovered through pictures left by your sister, you'll find your sister's stuffed rabbit, Otto. Your first real dash of color in the game, a crimson red rabbit in a world of gray-scale. With the rabbit in tow, you're able to double jump your way higher adding to the platforming experience. With Otto's help you're able to use telekinesis to lift items. Each new power helping identify Albert and Otto as it's own title and not just a copy of other somewhat similar games. The controls of the game were quick to pick up, An ease to platforming will allow you a quick start into Albert and Otto. The right analog stick combined with Right Trigger allows you to control Albert's pistol, a slow-reloading, but quick-downing weapon you'll need for ropes and bird's alike. The game ends abruptly for some, but is just the first in a three part series that has yet to be released. The boss fight, while I struggled, was easily the best part of the game on a whole. The music set a great atmosphere, peppered with screams and the dark world, the creep factor was high! If you like platforming and puzzles this game is a must purchase.",63,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Thankfully Assault Android Cactus can be included in these memorable experiences, and I would even go as far to say that this game is one the best twin-stick shooters I’ve ever played. The gameplay makes the game stand out in a big way and every little mechanic is flawless and very enjoyable, which is great. The amount of variety the game gives you is fantastic and the variety is especially shown in the weapons and enemies. Each weapon plays and feels different and the enemies are all unique and this in turn keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. If you like a challenge then this game will give you plenty of that. The boss battles are the epitome of challenging and they’re something I really enjoyed, but I will say that some people might find the bosses a little too difficult. When it comes to replay value the game has plenty and without a doubt you will sink a lot of hours into the game because each different mode keeps you satisfied. One thing that surprised me about the game was the story. The story in the game is absolutely brilliant and the added humour is actually funny and it makes the many characters in the game to have a lot of charm and in the end you fall in love with them. The presentation side of the game is one of my favourite parts about the game because once again everything is flawless.

ASTRONEER,Xbox One,System Era Softworks,"['Action Adventure', 'Sandbox']",E10+,2016-12-16,"This game is what no mans sky should have been. Astroneer is a game that requires you to use critical thinking to safely move across the massive planets, which gives the game a sense of difficulty even without the need for enemy npcs (unless you count the occasional dust storms that send damaging rocks flying towards you). Another great thing about the game are the planets. While there may only be about 4 or 5 in each save, each planet is massive and diverse. Your starting planet could be scarce of nearly anything, or it could be thriving with compounds around every corner. Planets also have nice details such as debris from what seem to be crashed spaceships, which makes the worlds feel so alive. While the graphics aren't ultra-realistic, the colorful and minimalist design makes the game still look beautiful and a joy to look at. The games soundtrack also fits the tone very well, giving the player a sense of awe and wonder, and makes you feel motivated to explore the game's gorgeous planets. The gameplay is also simple but addictive, and you get a massive amount of instant satisfaction any time you figure out how to do something in the game. One thing to note, is that the crafting system is very simple, maybe too simple for some, but it didn't bother me very much through my time in the game. The only gripe I have is that sometimes (though pretty rare) the player will clip through the ground and either fall to their death or suffocate.

Battle Chasers: Nightwar,Xbox One,Airship Syndicate Entertainment,"['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG', 'Japanese-Style']",T,2017-10-03,"I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how good Battle Chasers: Nightwar was. I’m not saying that I was expecting this game to be a bad game, but I didn’t think this RPG would be as rewarding as it was. The main attraction of this game is that it rewards you for doing any quest or completing anything noteworthy, and this makes you want to carry on with the game. The combat in the game is also something that makes the game stand out. They have managed to take the classic RPG turn based style and tweak it slightly to make the combat both exciting and interesting at the same time. The crafting mechanics in the game have a decent variety to them, and I enjoyed crafting the items and in my opinion it gave the game some more replay value. The story that accompanies the gameplay is very good and it manages to intrigue you throughout. The story also gives the characters a layer of depth to them and it definitely made me care about them more. I would however have liked the text to have been a bit bigger because I must admit that I struggled to read it at times and this did make me miss some important points. The presentation side of the game is simply stunning. The art style breaths life into the game and it definitely makes the game beautiful, which in turn makes it stand out. The music in the game is also brilliant and it delivers a number of different atmospheres for you to take part in. At the end of the day if you look past the technical issues then you will find a very competent and exciting RPG. The world is not as big as other games in the genre, but I don’t think it needs to be because the game has more than enough here to keep you satisfied.

Thankfully Battle Garegga Rev.2016 is a good addition to the genre, and the most important thing is that they’ve nailed all the basics. The gameplay is very fun and remains tight and responsive throughout which is very important in a game like this. I did however feel a little confused when playing the games at times because there’s a lot to take on board, so I was very surprised by the lack of tutorials. The campaign in the game has been done really well and there’s just enough to keep you satisfied throughout, some more modes would have been a welcome addition though. The game allows you to experiment with a lot of customisation options and this means you can tweak and change a lot of things which allows you a great sense of freedom. They have also done a good job of catering to a number of different gamers, and the inclusion of a number of different difficulties gives the game some replay value. There isn’t however enough replay value to justify the price tage though. The presentation side of the game is perfect in my opinion. Visually the game has a lovely retro style going for it, and this for me enhances the gameplay. I was also a fan of the music in the game and it never got on my nerves, which is great. At the end of the day Battle Garegga Rev.2016 is a game that I enjoyed quite a lot, and it does a great job of capturing the old-school shoot ’em up style. This game is really only for fans of shoot ’em up’s so it’s not for everybody, but fans of the genre will find a lot of enjoyable moments here. Battle Garegga Rev.2016 is a game that ultimately gets a recommendation from me, but I would however wait till the price of the game comes down.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thankfully the console version delivered in almost every area, and whilst it suffered with a few minor problems these were easily forgotten because there was a lot of enjoyment to be had here. A game like this focuses a lot on strategy and thankfully the strategy in the game has been basically done to perfection, which is great. Another great aspect of the game is the combat, and I must admit that I had a huge amount of fun when in battle and I got a great sense of reward when winning a battle. I did however have a few problems when fighting in larger battles because you couldn’t always tell what was going on, but thankfully this was a relatively small problem. The simplicity in the game really impressed me because they managed to keep things simple and made things have a lot of depth at the same time, which in turn means it’s accessible to different gamers. That’s a great idea because there is plenty of content for all us gamers to sink our teeth into, and the best thing is that you don’t seem to get bored very often. You will notice though that the longer you play it you will bump into a few technical issues and these can cause some frustration, but thankfully these don’t occur very often. The presentation side of the game has been done to perfection and the best thing is that they’ve made it very authentic, which is great for fans. The visuals and sound design work together really well and add another layer of immersion to the gameplay, which is awesome. At the end of the day Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is better than I expected, and that’s a very good thing indeed. I didn’t expect it to have as much depth as it did and if they bring a patch out to iron out the little issues the game has then you will be talking about an even better game. Issues aside the game does more than enough to get a recommendation from me and it’s definitely worth putting your time and effort into it.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Black Mirror,Xbox One,THQ Nordic,"['Adventure', '3D', 'Third-Person']",M,2017-11-28,"I was very excited to learn that Black Mirror was making a comeback, and I was hoping that it would be as good as the original. Thankfully this version does have a few things going for it, but unfortunately it also has a few too many problems which does make it difficult to get fully invested into the game. One of my favourite things about the game was definitely the story, and in my opinion it’s a fantastic story which remains gripping and interesting throughout. Unfortunately though the game does suffer with quite a few technical issues throughout and this does make the story less immersive, which is a shame because the story is so good. The atmosphere does help to combat the technichal issues and sometimes you will forget about them because the creepy atmosphere keeps you glued to the screen, but in the end you still notice the issues. The gameplay is a bit hit and miss, but on the whole the puzzles have been done really well and I found the controls to be responsive most of the time. My only real problem with the gameplay was the hideous camera, and the awkwardness caused a lot of frustration where there didn’t need to be any. I also became frustrated with the amount of loading screens that are dotted everywhere. I wouldn’t have minded as much if the loading screens were quick, but unfortunately they seem to go on forever and it can harm the rhythm of the game. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed, especially when it came to the sound design. The voice actors have done a fantastic job making the story even more believable and they make you connect with the story even more. The visuals are pretty decent as well, but I would have liked them to have made the game a little brighter. At the end of the day I must admit that when everything was said and done I was a little disappointed with this version of Black Mirror. Don’t get me wrong it does have some very good things going for it, but for the price the game is currently at I would have liked the problems to have been fewer. As it stands at the moment I can’t fully recommend Black Mirror, but once it reduces in price and has a patch or two then it may be worth purchasing.",57,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.3,Generally unfavorable reviews,1.0,1.0,6.0,33.0

They have managed to get the gameplay pretty much spot on, and without a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is when playing with friends. They have also added an online component so when your friends aren’t avaliable you can team up with somebody online. I found it very easy to get into a game online and I hardly suffered with any problems, which is great. When it comes to the difficulty curve the game can be a little unforgiving at times, and the idea of having no checkpoints can cause you a great deal of frustration. The movement of the characters can also cause you to be frustrated because they really do move at a snail’s pace. What the game really does well though is that it has a great deal of variety. There are a number of enemies for you to face and they all look and play differently, which is nice. You also have a lot of variety when it comes to the moves you can do and you feel very satisfied when pulling off a decent combo. The presentation side of the game is simple, but at the same time very effective. I was especially fond of the visuals in the game and each level has lots of colour and a nice amount of detail. At the end of the day fans of sidescrolling brawlers will have a lot of fun with Bloody Zombies, and it does stir up some wonderful memories from time to time. It does suffer with a few problems here and there, but they aren’t serious enough to dampen the fun factor. If you have a few friends over then Bloody Zombies will give you a very enjoyable night, and it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Blue Angels Aerobatic Flight Simulator,Xbox One,RORTOS SRL,"['Simulation', 'Flight', 'Combat']",E,2017-12-01,"I appreciate game’s that offer you a different experience from the usual game’s you play, but in order for you to fully enjoy these types of game’s they have to get quite a bit right. Unfortunately Blue Angels Aerobatic Flight Simulator gets more wrong than it gets right, and anything they do get right can be forgotten quite quickly. One of the biggest problems with the game is its lack of content. There really isn’t much for you to do in the game and the stuff that it does have gets repetetive quite quickly. Whilst it has a decent amount of missions to be getting on with they are unfortunately lacking in terms of variety and each mission feels pretty much the same. There is also a lack of variety when it comes to the locations you fly in and I expected a lot more here, but all you get is each location acting and performing in the same way. They do have some variety in the game when it comes to the difficulty settings and they’ve done a good job of making each setting feel different, and if they would have added more variety in other areas like they did here then the game would have definitely been better. The controls in the game are simple and remain responsive a lot of the time, but unfortunately they do lack in terms of realism and performing stunts never satisfies you because of this. The presentation side of the game is pretty good in some ways, and I especially liked the detail they gave to the Blue Angels. Unfortunately that’s the only detail you get, but the sound design makes you forget about that somewhat at times. At the end of the day I was kinda hoping for a lot more from this game, but in the end it failed to deliver in a number areas. Don’t get me wrong I understand that they had to work to quite a low budget, but that’s no excuse when it comes to certain problems the game possesses. Fans of flying game’s may find some enjoyment here but it will only be for a brief amount of time, and when it’s all said and done I unfortunately can’t recommend Blue Angels Aerobatic Flight Simulator to you.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Boiling Bolt,Xbox One,Plug In Digital,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Horizontal']",E,2017-12-05,"The shoot ’em up genre has been going for a long time now and there has been some game’s in this genre that have been absolutely brilliant and extremely addictive, unfortunately though Boiling Bolt doesn’t fall into this category. There are just too many problems that hold this game back and any positives are sadly short-lived and quickly forgotten. The problems start from the very beginning due to the technichal issues the game suffers with, and unfortunately some of these issues will put a lot of people off. This is a shame because the game does get some stuff right especially when it comes to the shooting mechanics, which remain fluid and responsive throughout. I also found the boss fights to be very well done and I must admit that I appreciated the creative side that went into them. Unfortunately though that’s pretty much where the positives end. The upgrades in the game are some of the worst I’ve ever come across and that was mainly down to them being completely useless, which is a problem because the game can be way too challenging at times so some help is desperately needed at times. The level design in the game doesn’t fare much better and all you mainly get are generic levels that completely lack in variety, which in turn makes the game become tedious quite quickly. They do have some decent variety when it comes to the enemies, but this is easily forgotten because of the lack of variety in other areas. The presentation side of the game is nothing to write home about and that’s mainly down to its bland design. Visually the game offers nothing memorable and the accompanying sound design does nothing to enhance your experience, which was a little disappointing. At the end of the day Boiling Bolt has entered a genre that has many classics at hand and if you don’t quite reach that standard or fall way behind that standard then you stick out like a sore thumb, which is unfortunately the case here. Don’t get me wrong it’s not the worst shoot ’em up I’ve ever played but it’s not even close to being the best shoot ’em up either, and when it’s all said and done I can’t recommend this game to you because there are much better game’s out there for you to play.",0,No score yet,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Bulb Boy,Xbox One,Bulbware,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",T,2017-10-06,"I grew up during the Nick Toon boom in the early 90’s, and I loved every series featured. To this day, I am in awe of some of the things they got away with in a kids show. Sadly, most kids today will never be able to experience the joy of Rocko at his phone sex operator position or Ren and Stimpy beating each other within an inch of their lives. Bulb Boy clearly took inspiration from these series, with its abstract design and light take on some pretty dark horror elements. You’ll begin your journey as the title character, Bulb Boy, who lives in a small house with his grandfather and dog-fly hybrid. After taking care of the narcoleptic grandpa, the boy puts himself to bed and the horror begins. He awakens in a slightly more abstract version of home and from the get go, things are off, even more so than the opening. Playing much like a point and click adventure, similar to the exploration elements of the Telltale game series, you’ll navigate light puzzles to work your way through the house and battle a number of boss characters. There are some platforming elements as well, navigating traps as the titular character with his detachable head. These are well designed and while not nearly as challenging as Limbo or Little Nightmares (review on Metacritic and Garage Band Gamers), they do require some trial and error, but are not nearly as dependent on timing. Even when dying repeatedly, the game never became frustrating or felt unfair. Luckily the load times are quick and the checkpoints are frequent. Since Bulb Boy’s head is made from a light bulb, he has the handy ability to provide his own light source throughout his journey, as well as the ability to remove his head and screw it into a number of other creatures or their corpses. These abilities cannot be swapped, as they are a means to completing your objectives, which are mainly puzzle based. Some of the puzzles are not obvious and do require a bit of exploration, looking for small arrows above the items or characters you can interact with. If you do get stuck, there is a handy hint tool that is optional and can be found in the pause menu. While I did use it a handful of times in my playthrough, the puzzles and design are easy enough to usually determine what is needed to be done, even without a detailed tutorial and no verbal queues. The controls are very basic and responsive, making this easy to navigate for gamers of all skill levels. While some events are timed, your brain will be getting more of a workout than your fingers. You’ll control Bulb Boy or a member of his family with the left stick, swap items with the bumpers, and select, use, or interact with the A button. The art design is top notch. While everything is abstract, Bulb Boy looks and plays like a Saturday morning cartoon of my childhood. Filled with a deep green or red tint, the setting is spooky enough to set the tone of the game without going overboard and being too scary for the younger gamers. My son sat with me throughout the time I spent playing this game, as if he was watching a cartoon, completely enthralled in the game world and it never reached the point of it scaring him. The boss fights are a highlight of the game, featuring enemies straight from a child’s nightmare. You’ll square off against giant light bulb eating turkeys, a strawberry spider plant hybrid, as well as your own gigantic turd. The last has successfully toppled the giant spider crab (Narcosis review on Garage Band Gamers) as my arch nemesis from any horror game. Defeating these enemies requires interacting with the environment in a specific order while dodging or avoiding their attacks. With the exception of the lackluster final encounter, which plays like a rhythm mini game that overstays its welcome, all are enjoyable. The game does fall on the short side, but with its modest price point I didn’t feel this was an issue. At the cost of less than a movie ticket, you’ll find a few hours’ worth of enjoyment. Sadly, there is not much replay value aside from collecting the standard achievements. Aside from completing these, there is not much of a reason to return to the game once it has reached its finale. With this being the only shortcoming, I highly recommend that you purchase this game during the Halloween season. While not nearly as terrifying as Outlast or Resident Evil 7, it does offer some spooky fun fit for gamers of most ages. With the exception of the bugs you will see in the background or interact with, Bulb Boy has been 100% glitch free. In this day and age, a game without issues is something we rarely see. I received my copy for review almost a week early, and without a single post launch update, this game ran seamlessly. In the age of day one updates, I tip my hat to Bulbware for releasing something finished and great from the start.",0,No score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,9.5,Universal acclaim,4.0,0.0,0.0,95.0

Call of Duty: Ghosts - Onslaught,Xbox One,Infinity Ward,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Modern', 'Arcade']",M,2014-01-28,"Now, let me preface this review by saying that I am a Call of Duty fanboy, but, for me at least, Ghosts feels like a massive step down from Treyarch's fantastic addition to the franchise; Black Ops II. Moving on to Onslaught, this map pack comes with three new MP maps, a remake, 2 new MP weapons, and another addition to the Extinction saga. Let's start with MP. For me, the on disc maps in Ghosts are among the worst in COD history. They're just too big for the tiny player cap. These DLC maps seek to fix this. The maps are small to medium sized and actually play surprisingly well. They're fast, frenetic, and actually fun, with the campy horror film inspired map, Fog, being among one of my favorites in all of COD DLC. The only blemish is the map Containment which feels like a map that was supposed to originally ship with the game. It's slow, there's too many spots to camp, and is just kinda boring to play. The new weapons; The Maverick and The Maverick A2, are lackluster. A slow and clunky assault rifle, and an unbalanced sniper variant make for a disappointing weapon DLC. Now we move on to the shining light in an overall average pack... Nightfall. Nightfall is a massive improvement over Point of Contact. However, newer players beware! This map is incredibly difficult compared to its rather tame predecessor, and actually took me quite some time to master. The story of Nightfall is actually really solid and is surprisingly well fleshed out through the collectible intel scattered around the map. These intel logs feature something that the main campaign mode lacked... capable voice actors and characters with some motivation and reason. The new boss cryptid; the breeder, is sadly, very under utilized. It's nothing more than a very generic boss fight that borders on unfair at times. Despite this, the ending cutscene of the map is very interesting, and really makes me excited to see where the story will go in ""Mayday"". Overall, Onslaught is an average DLC, but the new Extinction experience really is something special. Fans of Ghosts will be left feeling like they got their moneys worth, but those who weren't a fan of Ghosts should probably steer clear.",65,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,10.0,0.0,4.1,Generally unfavorable reviews,11.0,10.0,22.0,41.0

Circuits,Xbox One,Digital Tentacle S.L.,"['Puzzle', 'General']",,2017-12-15,"There aren’t many musical based game’s out there at the moment and this type of genre is definitely not for everybody, but I must admit that I’m a fan of the musical based genre of game’s. Thankfully Circuits gets more right than it gets wrong and in my opinion it’s a decent addition to the genre. Obviously the biggest and most important part of a game like this is the music, and thankfully they have got the music spot on. They have also the added bonus of decent visuals and these combine with the music extremely well. The puzzles in the game are very decent indeed and they have a great amount of variety to them, but unfortunately there isn’t enough of them. The content in the game is pretty low and there isn’t enough modes which is a shame because I know for a fact that this is a game I would play for quite a while if there was more content. The difficulty curve in the game has been managed well and the frustration levels never go to high because of that. Another thing they do to combat any frustration is that they offer you the right amount of hints during each puzzle and even when using a hint you still become very satisfied when completing a difficult puzzle/song. The only frustrating thing about the game was the controls because they can feel a little awkward and unresponsive at times and I think that’s mainly down to the game being designed for the PC first. Everything else though has been implemented perfectly to the console, which is a relief. At the end of the day if you ever fancy playing something different and you enjoy creating and listening to some very good music then you will thoroughly enjoy your time with Circuits. It is however a game that doesn’t have a long shelf life and the lack of content means that the game can be completed quite quickly, but at least the content they do have has been done really well. Without a doubt this game isn’t for everybody and some will find it tedious, but it ticked a lot of boxes for me and when it’s all said and done it gets a big thumbs up from me.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

And they did nothing to fix to some of the other issues, like still no auto saves, which was the bane of my playing existence in the first game. However this is still a great game and, for the price of 20 dollars, it's a steal in my opinion. Dead Rising 2 fixed alot of the problems from the first game like improved A.I. and added the crafting system that would become a major component in the games to come.

Dead Rising 4: Super Ultra Dead Rising 4 Mini Golf,Xbox One,Capcom Vancouver,"['Action Adventure', 'Open-World']",M,2017-06-20,"While I am not a golf enthusiast, this version of mini golf is mildly addicting and is the best piece of content released post launch for Dead Rising 4. The add-on is an arcade style mini-game that tasks you with playing golf, using absurdly large balls and one of the game’s many tools of destruction as a club. You will play golf in holiday themed levels based on areas from the game world, with zombies meandering around the courses. The game plays very similar to the Outlaw Golf franchise, with fairly simple controls. While it does take a few attempts to get the timing down for a perfect swing, the game is pretty forgiving. This mode can be played solo or locally/online with up to 3 other players. While I would like to say its fun to play this mode with other friends, I have yet to experience this since the online lobby for the Xbox One has been dead since this expansion was released. Regardless of how you play, you’ll earn cash to purchase cosmetic items for your player, as well as new clubs and balls. These are a bit grindy but are worth the effort, as each upgrade does improve your game drastically. This doesn’t reinvent the golf genre, nor does it take the place of an official game, but Super Ultra Dead Rising Mini Golf is a nice break from the standard zombie slaying or the frustration normal golf games offer.

Deadbeat Heroes,Xbox One,Deadbeat Studios,"['Action', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", '3D']",T,2017-10-10,"There have been some very good button mashers over the years and the main reason why they’ve been good is because they’ve been fun and enjoyable. Deadbeat Heroes is fun and enjoyable sometimes but unfortunately it doesn’t happen enough. I was however very impressed with the combat in the game and it’s surprisingly very exciting when building up a massive combo. The game however is far too difficult and when you get to the later levels it really does feel impossible to complete which means you get frustrated a lot. Another thing that frustrated me is when you complete a level it sends you straight back to the main menu and you have to rejoin the game each time, which in turn annoys you quite a bit. Without a shadow of a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is when you play it in local co-op. Me and my friends had an incredible amount of fun with the different enemies, and the variation in the enemies keeps things fresh and exciting. The variation doesn’t occur throughout the game though and that is evident in the level design, which unfortunately is a little basic and generic. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed because it has an unusual look that makes the game stand out. This unusual look is especially seen in the visuals, and the art style here definitely tickled my fancy. The sound design is more basic than the visuals but it does just enough to complement the gameplay. At the end of the day I can’t help but feel that Deadbeat Heroes could have been so much better. Don’t get me wrong it isn’t a bad game by any means, but it’s a game that is unfortunately average when it could have been very good. The niggling problems do harm the fun and enjoyabilty the game gives you, but there is just enough fun here to get a small recommendation from me.",61,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
DeadCore,Xbox One,Grip Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Arcade']",E,2017-07-14,"Have you ever had a game that you’ve hated with every iota of your soul, yet you couldn’t stop playing it? Being the model of self-control, simply by not throwing the controller into the wall or kicking your dog? For most of my 32 years on this planet, Battletoads has held that crown, but recently I was given Deadcore, which has managed to challenge, if not topple it for the “most likely to push me to throw a console into a woodchipper” trophy. You’re tasked with climbing a strange, Tron-ish tower competing in a one man race against whomever designed said tower. Visually, everything is extremely blocky and features designs and colors ripped straight from the Tron series. While not awful looking, it’s very bland. With little to offer in the visual or story departments, Deadcore’s main draw is the rush you get upon completing one of its many trial and error style challenges at breakneck speed. I am not exaggerating when I say breakneck speed, as the game runs like Doom-guy was thrust into Portal after being given a hefty amount of meth and a case of Red Bull. Forcing the player to barrel through the level like Sonic on crack after you have gotten the lay of the land does work. However, the time prior to this will be kind of frustrating, as you will probably fall to your death more often than not. While there is a tutorial, it is very basic; you’ll be running, jumping, and utilizing parkour to climb your way up the tower. Eventually you will get an energy rifle of sorts. This rifle acts as a key to open doors, is a means of defense by deactivating turrets or mobile sentries, and is used to flip switches. The controls for said weapon are accurate and work as they should; however, the rest of the controls, particularly the ones for movement, could use some work. While the buttons are limited to the triggers and sticks, aside from a reload button assigned to a face button, this game was designed to be played using a mouse and keyboard. While 5 Bits Games did an acceptable job porting this game to consoles, the controls are not nearly as accurate as they should be, especially for this style of game. This will lead to a number of deaths due to player error, glitches, or poor design choices. Luckily, you can reload at any time by pressing the button mentioned earlier, or simply by falling to your death. Additionally, load times are quick and let you get back into your run as quickly as possible, putting you back at your most recent checkpoint, which are frequent and fair. The technical glitches mentioned previously are fairly minor; similar to a thug shooting you through a wall in Hotline Miami, the game will occasionally break its own rules. Just as often, I was able to manipulate one of the glitches to boost myself past a difficult challenge or cut a large chunk of my time from a run. The only glitch that really frustrated me was at the beginning of the game: I was forced to do the first mission a total of 4 times. While tiresome, it did show me how much fun the game can be when running through the level as quickly as possible to beat my previous time. Each level took me approximately 15 minutes to an hour on my first run, and with subsequent trials I was able to shave off minutes or even cut the time in half. Upon completing each level, there is the option to go back into the game to attempt a speed run. There are also collectibles and leaderboards to see how you stack up against the rest of the community. With this being said, there is a lot of replay value offered here. While not as polished or pretty as other puzzle games out there, Deadcore is a worthwhile addition to your library if you’re looking for something different.",69,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Three words that may more accurately describe it is “simplistic but effective”. My first encounter with game was at RTX Sydney, watching from the far back in the sweaty hordes, as the team from FunHaus took on the Achievement Hunters, and I knew in that moment I had to review it, it just looked THAT fun. It was an itch I had to scratch. Home grown and produced on Australian turf, Death Squared is an arcadey puzzler with an exceptional approach on co-op play. Instead of working against each other, it is pivotal to work as a team, no lone wolf in this game. This game encourages communication whether it be helpful hints, aggressive advice, or flipping the bird in jest at your fellow teammates because you solved the problem first. The story begins with the sarcastically but oddly charmingly voiced, David. Not much is known about our elusive protagonist, other than he is testing (through your control) the intellectual ability of brightly coloured, adorable, little robots, for the tech company OmniCorp. Along the way you interact in conversations with IRIS the A.I computer running the tests. The banter is real between them and the conversations often quite comically set up the storyline. I know at home you are thinking this is very similar to Portal, and I suppose the premise is, but this game is oh so subtly different when you are actually playing. You must control both blue and red robots, or one each with a partner, through 80, 3D, puzzled landscapes to an achievement marker, avoiding obstacles such as pits, spikes and laser beams, and using switches and barricades to assist along the way. Controlling these Rubik cubish robots is as simple as using the analogue sticks independently, to control one or the other, not one button is even needed (simple, right?). For such simple, pint-sized androids, these little chaps are brimming with character. It almost felt painful when they died, or exploded into a spray of nuts and bolts before your very eyes (effective, right?). My only critique of the actual gameplay is at times the movement can be a bit touchy, often sending your miniature pals careening over the edge to their doom. This only meant more precision play was needed the next time or seven.... The Story/Co- Op Mode maybe the bread and butter of the game but the Party Mode is where the fun is turned up a volume. Now let me start off by saying, I like reviewing games. Yes, it is fun to play a new release but it also often gives me the opportunity to review myself as a ‘gamer’. Upon reviewing this game, it brought me to ponder over the fact of when did I start to prefer to game alone? And why? Long gone are the days we’d all gather together on the couch and play a game. Death Squared makes you relive that past. In Party Mode, up to four players can each have their own robot to traverse the test chambers in 40 new levels. The puzzles are considerably more difficult in this mode as it requires a lot of communication. It was amusing watching my friends jump up and down next to me with new ideas, and even funnier to watch them fail. We yelled over each other in excitement, and rehashed and evaluated plans when they fell apart. The challenge then was talking your way through synchronizing movements, it became an actual art form in itself. Frustrating but also so exhilarating when you got that gratifying tick of completion. This game is all about learning. Learning from your mistakes, learning new ideas, learning new strategies and learning from your friends. The sense of reward after completing any level is what keeps you coming back for more. “Just one more level...” often crept out my lips as I was pushing along my little, Rockstar decaled cube. Overall the game play is that straightforward it is mind blowing. Simple normally means entertainment is sacrificed but this is certainly not the case. I really enjoyed myself, the puzzles were challenging but not too annoyingly, you’d want to rage quit or throw your controller (I have issues). Death Squared is certainly a case of less is more. Review brought to you by MKAUGaming Australia",80,Generally favorable reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Deer Hunter: Reloaded,Xbox One,GameMill Entertainment,"['Sports', 'Individual', 'Nature', 'Hunting']",T,2017-10-24,"I’m a massive fan of hunting games and fans of the genre have been treated to some very good hunting games this year. Unfortunately Deer Hunter: Reloaded is not even close to being very good and I must admit that I hated my time with the game, which is a shame because I’m a big fan of this particular series. The AI in the game is awful and it’s enough to put you off straight away, but unfortunately that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the problems this game has. The movement in the game will have you pulling your hair out because you move at a snail’s pace and there is no way to speed up, which is stupid. The biggest sin in the game and it has a lot is that the game lacks any sort of a personality and it’s nothing like the previous game’s in the series because they were enjoyable. It does have a few bright moments every now and then when it comes to the responsive controls and some of the missions, but these bright moments are very few and far between. When it comes to content the game offers you very little and I think it’s a cardinal sin that no leaderboards were included because at least that would have given you a small reason to continue playing. The presentation side of the game is hideous and something I really hated. Visually the game looks ugly and lacks character and the sound design sounds nothing like hunting, which is awful. At the end of the day if you want a good hunting game then you should stay clear of Deer Hunter: Reloaded at all costs. I hate not recommending games but this is a game that I can’t even give a slight recommendation to because it gets so much wrong. Without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst game the series has ever created and in my opinion it’s put a stain on their reputation.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
Defunct,Xbox One,Freshly Squeezed,"['Adventure', '3D', 'Third-Person']",,2017-12-19,"Defunct is one of them rare game’s that has a number of different mechanics all in play at the same time, and for the most part it delivers in all of these areas which in turn creates a very enjoyable experience. The gameplay in the game shines through a lot of the time and that’s mainly down to them giving you a lot of freedom to use speed and exploration at the same time. Thankfully the controls hold up really well throughout the game which is definitely important because the game can become very difficult and the worst thing is that the difficulty curve seems to come out of nowhere. My favourite thing about the game is the level design. The reason I say level design is because you can tell a lot of thought and effort went into each level and I loved that they allow you to complete a level using multiple routes. This freedom though can cause you a few problems at times because you do have to backtrack a lot and when doing this you can get lost, so some frustration will be present at times. Thankfully there was no frustration when it came to the puzzles and in my opinion the puzzles were designed really well and did a great job of adding something different to the gameplay. If you are looking for a game with tons of content then you won’t find it here and I must admit that I was a little disappointed by how short the game was. The presentation side of the game is brilliant in my opinion. The reason I think it’s brilliant is because they’ve done a great job of making the visuals and sound design look and sound fun and they’ve also made it accessible to all gamers, which is great. At the end of the day I didn’t think I would enjoy Defunct as much as I did and I love it when a game surprises me. Don’t get me wrong this game is far from being perfect and the niggling problems can be a nuisance at times, but you can look past these problems because it gets a number of things right and because of that it gets a thumbs up from me.",0,No score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Disney Infinity 2.0 Edition,Xbox One,Avalanche Software,"['Action Adventure', 'General', 'Fantasy']",E10+,2014-09-23,"This game is a significant improvement over the previous installment; however, there are still a few things missing. The controls of the characters are awesome. I absolutely love using the characters that have flight (Iron Man and Nova) because maneuvering them is easy, fun and provides seamless transitions between flight and combat (gives me hope for a good Superman game to come). However, there are a few things that still need be worked out. First, is that you cannot play any of the play sets from the first game. I know recoding it for the new version would be so much work; but, I would love it if down the road it became a possibility. I no longer have my xBox360 and the play sets from the first game just sit now (Great work porting the rest of the game). Second, the development tools are still not the most user friendly aspect of the game. I never got into the building part of 1.0 (too in depth) and I am still wishing for a tutorial that makes building a lot easier. Minecraft is very simple, aim...place....done. I still don't understand how logic works and although they are trying to give ""infinite"" options someone like me needs a dumbed down version. Lastly, there are way too many bugs in the game. In going through the tutorial it would tell us to do varying missions all of which were inaccessible. We were supposed to save a princess and when we got there the gate would not open and the enemies to battle did not populate. When we were supposed to do racing challenges the cars for us to race in would not populate and the only way to keep playing was to abort the missions all together. My last suggestion would be more characters that older generations know. I love the Marvel line up; but, I would love to see characters like Wolverine, Cyclops and Deadpool and characters like Tron, Baloo, Darkwing Duck, classic Mickey and Goofy and Gizmo Duck. The majority of characters stem from movie releases (I know its good marketing); but, the Disney universe is so much greater than Guardians of the Galaxy which was foreign to most people last year. Overall, it really is a good game with a TON of fun and hours of co-play. I have a very man's man (Call of Duty, Battlefield) friend and he even admits to enjoy this new version. We played for a few hours just trying to shoot one another in an arena. I highly recommend adding it to your library. Like the name suggest it really is an infinite game and with every new play set release, you have an entirely new game to play with characters.

Don Bradman Cricket,Xbox One,Big Ant Studios,"['Sports', 'Team', 'Cricket']",E,2015-02-11,"Cricket, I reckon, is one of the, if not he hardest sport to make a truly great video game out of. The reason being is that cricket is a game that takes patience, some matches go for DAYS in real life. This means that picking the game up and playing a match with friends can be more difficult than other games such as FIFA or NBA 2k. Big Ant studios countered this by implementing casual 5-5 games witch can be finished as much as 30 minutes less than the games longest mode, 4 day test match. They came close to perfection with the player career mode. in the career mode you can start as young as 16 years old, starting out with teams from states, counties etc. and working your way up through t20 leagues and finally making it to the international games. The mode has an effective way of telling you how close to achieving a spot in each league. This uses ranking points, you get ranking points after finishing games. The amount of ranking points can vary based on how well you performed in that game. It also has a player creation system, which(in my opinion) is the most advanced in a sports game to date.

Don Bradman Cricket 17,Xbox One,Big Ant Studios,"['Sports', 'Team', 'Cricket']",E,2016-12-15,"Great cricket game. Many, many additions from DBC14 the big one is Game-play modifiers (sliders).. Much more customization (bats/logos/stadiums) Already most teams/players and stadiums have already been created by very talented people on Planet-cricket forums. It's basically a cricket sandbox game, you play it how you want to play it from players/kits/stadiums/match types/pitch conditions/game-play sliders... With the added academy features shame to see no stump customization/ boundary rope ads/ball sponsors/overlays like you could with adding files like modding on DBC14 yet. I hope this could be added in future updates. Yes the console release of this game was (buggy) to say the least (I have the xbox1 version as well) but the PC version at the moment is a big improvement with many fixes already applied to this PC version. As I'm writing this a PATCH 3 has been submitted for consoles to bring it up to far with PC version.The graphics are a step up from previous game. Game runs very smooth on my pc at 1440p 144hz (980ti) Bowling is very enjoyable with many differences in edges and delivery types. The bowling hud is much smaller and easier to understand. Batting is very good too. I'm just not as good at batting than bowling :) much more choice in shots i.e advance down the wicket shot now can play along the ground or go in the air. One negative so far is the CUT shot animation is not very good in my opinion.. I can't remember seeing a cut shot played like that ever. Much more precise with shots better controls for shots like precise shots (RB) and such. Commentary is a bit odd/repetitive at times but so happy to see James Taylor be apart of the game.Fielding is a little slow, able to hit and run most times in the circle even when hitting it right to the fielders, ball tracking for the fielders seems a little off as well at times. Few bugs here or there but BA have a very good track record of fixing things very swiftly on the PC and have committed to delivering one of the best cricket games on PC. The game will only improve with many future fixes/updates. I have every faith in them to deliver like they did for DBC14 I fully recommend this game to anyone who likes cricket, It's a very enjoyable game.",83,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,0.0,0.0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,15.0,0.0,5.0,74.0

Drift Zone,Xbox One,"Awesome Industries sp. z o.o., Awesome Industries","['Action', 'General']",E,2018-01-26,"I must admit that I didn’t know a lot about this game before reviewing it and sometimes that can be a either good thing or bad thing. Thankfully there is more good about Drift Zone than bad, and whilst it’s far from perfect I still managed to have a pretty enjoyable time with the game. Obviously the most important thing of a game of this ilk is the cars, and surprisingly enough they have a decent variety of cars to choose from. Each car feels and sounds different and this made it worth while to check out each car. Each car in the game can be customised quite a bit and it was pretty fun trying to get the style I wanted for my car. Unfortunately there isn’t a huge amount of content for you to get to grips with and I can’t see this game having much replayability for a lot of people. I will say though that the content that is present is pretty good and the gameplay on the whole has been done quite well. I didn’t suffer with any problems when it came to the controls and it was a nice surprise that they remained fluid and responsive throughout. If you’re looking for realism though then you will be sadly disappointed with this game. The vehicle damage is not very good and drifting can seem like a chore at times which in the end harms the immersion. This is a shame because the tracks can be quite immersive at times and there is a decent amount of variety present here. The presentation side of the game is the biggest let down in my opinion because there clearly is a lack of polish here. Visually the game just looks like a bog standard title and the sound design does nothing much to impress, which is a shame. At the end of the day if you don’t go into this game expecting too much then you will find yourself having quite a few enjoyable moments. Without a doubt this game is purely an arcade game at heart and it doesn’t try to be anything different, which in the end gives the game it’s good points and bad points. Drift Zone is a game that can be quite appealing at times but only in short bursts because if you play it for long periods then you will find that it becomes tedious quite quickly. I will say though that it does just enough to get a small recommendation from me just don’t expect too much.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Dungeons 3,Xbox One,Realmforge Studios,"['Strategy', 'General']",T,2017-10-17,"I’m a big fan of the Dungeons series and I have had quite a lot of enjoyment on both the previous games, but in my opinion the previous games lacked polish but thankfully this has been rectified a lot in Dungeons 3. I found the campaign to be more interesting in this game, and the variety in each mission keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. I was also impressed with the difficulty curve in the game because they ease you in gently and this in turn makes the game more accessible to all gamers. Dungeons 3 does however have a few limitations and the biggest limitation for me was the population you can have, and in my opinion it would have been better if they allowed you to have more of a population. The story in the game continues to be interesting and the added humour never outstays its welcome because the humour is actually pretty funny. The gameplay as ever has been done really well. Each different mechanic in the game works really well, and this in turn keeps the gameplay fun and exciting throughout. At times the game does suffer with some technical issues though but none of these issues really impact the game’s drawing power instead they just cause a slight annoyance. The presentation side of the game is where the game has seen the most polish. Visually the game has a nice amount of detail, and the sound design does a very good job of making you become immersed in the game. At the end of the day in my opinion Dungeons 3 is definitely the best game in the series so far. There is still a few niggling problems that remain, but they have managed to improve in most areas and that is certainly the case with the amount of polish the game has had put into it. Fans of these types of games will absolutely love this addition and for the amount of effort the game has had put into certain areas it definitely gets a big thumbs up from me.",72,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,2.0,0.0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,0.0,1.0,74.0
Dustoff Heli Rescue 2,Xbox One,Invictus,"['Simulation', 'Flight', 'Civilian']",E10+,2017-12-26,"I have been waiting for a game like the original Choplifter to come out for a long long time and I can still remember how much fun I had with Choplifter back in the day because it was a simple yet very enjoyable affair. Thankfully Dustoff Heli Rescue 2 is as close to the original Choplifter as you can get, and whilst it suffers with a few problems I still ended up having a great time with the game. There are a number of missions for you to tackle in the game and they’ve done a brilliant job of making each mission feel considerably different and in a way very exciting. I will say though that some levels can become very difficult and dealing with a number of hazards can be a frustrating affair at times. Thankfully the controls hold up really well and don’t cause any more frustration, so if you make a mistake it’s down to you and not the controls. In order to play new levels you will have to unlock a number of stars and getting these stars can be a testing affair. They do however keep the grind interesting by throwing in a number of unlockables for you to sink your teeth into and this gives the game quite a lot of replay value. Most of the unlockables in the game are pretty decent, but I was a little disappointed with the weapons and the main reason for that is because every weapon pretty much felt and reacted in the same way. The presentation side of the game is something that I didn’t expect to enjoy as much as I did. Visually the game has a Minecraft feel to it and I think this particular style works very well for the game. The sound design also delivers in a number of areas and the different sounds definitely add a touch of immersion to the game. At the end of the day Dustoff Heli Rescue 2 is a simple game to get to grips with and this simplicity makes the game accessible to a number of different gamers. They do a very good job of easing you in and the tutorials leave no stone unturned, so you go into the game with a lot of confidence. There are a few niggling problems here and there but the game delivers a lot of nostalgia so I kinda forgot about them and in the end it does more than enough to get a thumbs up from me.",0,No score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I will say however that I thought the puzzles in the game were some of the most intricately designed puzzles I’ve ever played, and I was very thankful with the amount of effort that’s gone in here. Unfortunately though the controls when taking part in these puzzles can be very awkward at times, and in my opinion the controls cause frustration where there doesn’t need to be. I also got frustrated with how slow you travel in the game and I was amazed that they didn’t include a run button. Some people I’ve spoke to said they didn’t like the story in the game, but I actually quite enjoyed it and the voice over work did a great job of creating a strange and weird atmosphere. Speaking about the atmosphere I thought the strange vibe was done really well and in my opinion it kind of gave the game a unique feel. What didn’t feel unique though was the inventory, and the inventory did a great job of annoying me because it just feels clunky and unresponsive throughout. The presentation side of the game is nothing special, but it does just enough to make an impact. Visually the game can look a bit ugly at times but the accompanying sound design is actually pretty good and it sets the scene very well at times. At the end of the day I’m not sure which genre Dying: Reborn wants to be in, and this confusion actually takes away from the game. I definitely wouldn’t call it a horror game because it isn’t scary, but I would probably call it a puzzle adventure game and when it’s like this I actually enjoyed the game. Dying: Reborn is either a game you’ll like or dislike and because of that I can’t fully recommend it, which is a shame because it does have a few unique moments.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

EVERSPACE,Xbox One,ROCKFISH Games,"['Action', 'Action Adventure', 'General', 'Open-World']",T,2016-09-23,"Wow, talk about a surprise. This gem popped onto the Xbox store out of nowhere and was able to hook me in immediately. I'm a big fan of rouge-like games, as well as the space shooters, so this was right in my wheelhouse. I sank quite a bit of time in the game Elite: Dangerous and have been waiting for another chance to get back into a cockpit and blast other ships into stardust. Little did I know that my first few runs of this game were spent dying almost immediately. As like other games in the rogue-like genre (or in this case, rogue-lite), progression is based on the players ability to collect the necessary supplies credits to upgrade their ship in between runs. These vary from energy upgrades that are needed to power the ships weapons, defenses, and boosters, to making it easier to find rare loot or credits in future runs. This hub is also where you can customize the ship's color, and loadouts. Credits are not the only source for ship upgrades either; many of the most essential upgrades are procedurally generated in the world and will have to be equipped on the spot or salvaged in order to be utilized during the run. These will be lost once the run is over. Blue prints may also be obtained for crafting items that will be fitted to the ship in between runs. All of these upgrades will be needed in order to last long in one of the many firefights that will be encountered while jumping from sector to sector. Gameplay in Everspace is really divided into 2 main parts: exploring each sector for valuable resources that are used for crafting/trading/repairing, and dog fighting. Many times when jumping to a new area, the player will be thrust into a fire fight with opposing factions, each time with more skilled pilots with increased fire power. Be prepared to be slaughtered early on in your career by small groups of ships, as it's easy for even low level drones to annihilate your health bar and shields with just a few bursts of laser and gattling gun fire. After a while you will be able to hold your own, and will be more capable of surviving more battles. Ship maintenance will be necessary during runs in order to keep moving forward. The ship will be subject to standard hull damage, as well as damage to specific parts of the ship that will stay crippled until repaired with collected items. This leads to tense moments when your life support system is slowly draining all while you desperately search the current system for necessary items to fix it. At the time of writing this, I've only made it to the 4th sector out of 7, so I can't say too much about the later half of the game. I imagine that it will take me several more runs to make it all the way to the end. Everspace fits a certain niche of game that is highly addictive and rewarding once the learning obstacle has been passed. This game really is something special, and I'm really surprised that I hadn't heard of it before yesterday. The game is beautiful and the environments become more and more inhabited as you progress with factions blowing each other up in the distance that can either be joined, or looted once the battle is over. There is a story here that gradually unwinds as later sectors are reached, but it isn't particularly interesting and really just gives a loose premise on how the playable character can get blown into oblivion and still keep coming back. This is the Xbox One version of the game, and I haven't ran into any glitches, but I've had several crashes. This being a PC port, I imagine this will be patched soon, and I also imagine that this game will do very well on the Xbox marketplace. Plus, it's discounted price tag will bring in a lot of potential buyers. If you're looking for that next space shooter, or that next addictive rouge-like that will get its hooks into you, this is definitely worth a look.",84,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,0.0,0.0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,2.0,2.0,71.0

Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince,Xbox One,Gamera Interactive,"['Action', 'Puzzle']",,2017-12-12,"I love it when a game surprises me in a good way and without a doubt Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince surprised me in a good way. I must admit that I didn’t expect to enjoy this game as much and the main reason I enjoyed it so much is because it got a lot of the mechanics right. The puzzles which play a massive part in the game are absolutely perfect and the clever design plays a part in each individual puzzle. They have also managed to get the difficulty spot on and by doing this it means you don’t get frustrated very often when taking on the puzzles, which is great. Another important thing in a game like this is the controls and thankfully they remain both fluid and responsive throughout, which means you can focus solely on the tasks at hand without worrying about any problems. I must admit that I was surprised with the amount of content the game offers you and without a doubt you definitely get value for money. There are 75 levels for you tackle and some of them are pretty fun, but I would have liked to have had a little more variety with the level design. I would have also liked to have had a bit more in the way of a story and I think more of a story would have made the gameplay even better. The presentation side of the game pleased me a great deal and it also has the added bonus of stirring up some fond memories, especially when it came to the visuals. The visuals in the game have a real retro look to them and they complement the gameplay ever so well. At the end of the day Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince is definitely a hidden gem. It’s a game that creates a very enjoyable experience and it makes you want to revisit time and time again, which is pretty rare with game’s like this. There is a little bit of everything in the game and this means that Fearful Symmetry will attract a number of different gamers. Also the price of the game is spot on and in a way undervalued and when it’s all said and done this game gets a massive thumbs up from me.",71,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Feral Fury,Xbox One,Skandivania Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Top-Down']",T,2017-08-30,"According to Google, the natural enemy of a Panda is the human; however, in Feral Fury you’ll face what appear to be elephants, dogs, robots, and a large selection of bugs. The game’s narrative, which is given in an all too brief cut scene at the launch of the game (the rest came from the press kit I was provided), is that after the fall of humanity, Pandas have become the dominant life form. As they are in desperate need of bamboo, they have left in search of a new planet to inhabit. You’ll take control of one of what will be many Pandas to battle the forces of evil, or good, depending on how you look at the narrative. The game is a twin stick rouge-lite adventure, very similar to the popular The Binding of Isaac; you’ll start each game or run in the same place, with a maze of rooms that change on each run. The biggest difference between the two games is the upgrade system featured here. You’ll collect blue orbs from fallen enemies which can be redeemed for perks such as extra health slots or upgrades to your weapons and abilities, which will carry over between games. If you are new to this genre, permadeath is in full force and will be experienced frequently, as Feral Fury is unforgiving, even on the easiest setting. Featuring 15 levels spread across 5 chapters, I was only able to make it to the third chapter on easy, which omits the boss fights featured in the higher difficulties. As a jab to the player, these are replaced with a room full of baby pigs that won’t attack you , and instead give you a number of additional power ups and weapons. After completing a chapter, you are given the option of progressing through a door or leaving using a Warthog-ish vehicle. The second option places you in a vehicular combat setting. I found these to be particularly frustrating, as you are only able to shoot in short bursts while waves of enemies swarm you. After a few attempts at this, I decided continuing on foot was the best course of action. The power ups offered in Feral Fury are significantly weaker than those found on the other popular rouge-lites. However, there is a large variety of them based off of the glossary in the menu. It’s important to note that while there is a wide range of guns that can be acquired, they run on ammo, unlike the pistol which is endless. These do add a strategic element, and a bad decision can come back to bite you in the ass due to the randomized nature of the game. Picking up a grenade launcher and then running into enemies that charge you is an instant death sentence. There are a number of secrets to be found if the player takes the time to explore (or reads about them online) such as attacking the store vendors, who will put up a nasty fight, but the rewards you receive for winning add a nice risk to reward aspect. In addition to these, hidden rooms can be found by blowing up explosives found in the environment as well as using your limited number of bombs. You’ll also find wishing wells that can add a curse (negative effect) or perk. Luckily, if you are cursed, most statuses are removed at the end of a level. My secret was a Galaga mini game found in an arcade room, which I was better at than the main game. In addition to the story mode, you’ll find additional difficulties and a daily run that adds 3 perks as well as a curse to your character. This mode does feature a leaderboard, so you can see where you fall within the community. I particularly enjoyed the visual style of the game, as it appears to be heavily inspired by the original Doom series, with its dark corridors and the design of the characters’ armor. Additionally, you will have to find color coded keys which resemble the old school design of the Doom keycard. You’ll be tasked with finding red keys to unlock the exit to the level and blue, which can be used to open chests or access the stores. I would recommend taking advantage of the upgrade system and buying the extra blue key upgrade early in the game, as this extra chest will greatly increase your chance for survival, especially if obtained early. While Feral Fury does lack the staying power and variety that The Binding of Isaac offers, its difficulty and replay options will keep most players busy for hours to come.",0,No score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The game controls can get confusing for non flyer type gamers. i feel that the graphics are a 8/10 because of the face that it looks similar to a flight  simulator when you are in first person mode but overall i would love to give the game a 8/10 beacuse of the face that the game features planes that are no longer used in modern day times and the feel of flying and using an old fighter jet and or bomber is really nice! the story concept of the game is 10/10 script wise and you feel like you are the pilot with how some of the dialog goes in the stoy campaign mode! Now for the multiplayer aspect of the game could use a but work was kind of difficult to find out how to ing people to play it with and some of the options to host a multiplayer lobby was kinda good, but as I said before trying to invite other players was a but difficult to do. So my overal oppinion of your game is 9/10. Why such high rating well I am a fan of flyers and well your game was very indept on how it was presented to the masses, its fun even children under 15 I would recomend it for them to play because of the game play, storytelling, and not much inappropriate things displayed by that i mean none at all it's a good and wonderful game that should be rated E for everyone. Thanks for the oppertunity to be able to play your wonderful game and I hope the best for the maker's of flying tigers.",67,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The third “Classic” mode is zen mode where again is time based but there are no bombs. There are four new single player modes that you can choose from in the “Festival” menu. Each new mode has a new character to introduce the new mode. Katsuro’s Ninja Dodge Dodge is a mode where shurikens are being thrown at you while slicing as much fruit as you can. More and faster shurikens are thrown as you successfully dodge more and more. Mari’s Strawberry Stealth puts your Ninja skills to the test by slicing fruit while avoiding moving spotlights. Being spotted sounds the alarm and points are lost the longer you stay in the spotlight. So if your shoulder just seen for a split second, less points are lost than if you do your best deer in a headlight impression and just stand there. Nobu’s Bamboo Strike is a mode where you have to slice the bamboo seeds before they hit the ground. Miss one and bamboo will grow to block you from slicing fruit. Han’s Apple Range is probably my favorite new mode. You have to throw knives at fruit instead of slice them. There are targets that pop down that you have to hit with your knives. Fruit Ninja 2 is $14.99 on the Xbox Store. In my opinion that’s a little pricey for a game that doesn’t have too much content.

The developers have made the game very fun and addictive and most important of all is it’s very rewarding, which is great. In the game there are four characters for you to try out and trying them out was very fun. Each character has had a lot of thought and effort put into them and the variety each character has keeps things fresh throughout. The gameplay on the whole is super addictive and has loads of interesting concepts in play at the same time. You would expect the gameplay to be complicated because of this, but thankfully they keep things simple which makes the game accessible to a lot of gamers. Whilst it may be simple in its approach it does however get a tad too difficult at times and the difficulty seems to spike out of nowhere which can be a little frustrating at times. Thankfully though the progression system makes you forget about the difficulty and makes you determined to carry on. I say this because the progression system has been done to perfection and the best thing is that it delivers you tons of replay value. Those who are fans of the strategy side of game’s may be a little disappointed here because there isn’t much in terms of variety here unfortunately. Something that really surprised me about the game though was how fun and charming the story was. The story remains interesting throughout and the way they tell the story has a unique feel to it, which is great. The presentation side of the game ticked a lot of boxes for me and I was especially fond of the visuals. The pixel-art visuals fit the game’s style very well and the accompanying sound design also holds up really well. At the end of the day I love it when a game reaches my lofty expectations and thankfully that’s exactly what Full Metal Furies does. You can tell from the get go that a lot of love and effort has gone into the game and this makes everything about the game stand out in a good way. It’s both fun and addictive when playing on your own or with friends and the simplicity of the game means things never get too frustrating, which is something that I really liked, and without a doubt Full Metal Furies gets a massive thumbs up from me.",0,No score yet,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Future War:Reborn,Xbox One,Good net technology co. Ltd,"['Action', 'Third-Person', 'Shooter', 'Arcade']",T,2017-12-20,"We’ve seen quite a few mobile game’s come to consoles recently and most of them haven’t been very good, and unfortunately Future War: Reborn doesn’t set the world alight either. I will say however that this is not the worst mobile ported game I’ve ever played and it does have some good points. The gameplay in the game is actually pretty decent and it does provide some enjoyable moments, but unfortunately it’s very brief. You will notice that the amount of content is pretty lacklustre and there isn’t much replay value to be had here, which will put a lot of people off because the price tag is a little too high for the content you get. There are not many levels for you to get to grips with and that’s probably a good thing because the level design is severely lacking when it comes to variety. There is also a shortage of variety when it comes to the enemies and facing them does become tedious which is a shame because I thought the weapons were pretty fun to use. Something they did get right though was the controls that were implemented. When using these controls you would never think that this game started off on mobile devices because they’ve done a brilliant job of making the controls smooth and responsive throughout. The presentation side of the game is not the best and you can tell straight away that there has been little effort to make it different from the mobile port. Visually the game looks ugly most of the time and there isn’t really much that’s memorable. The sound design doesn’t do much better and in the end it just ends up getting on your nerves. At the end of the day in order to make a mobile port become successful on a console you have to tweak little things to make it look like it belongs on console and in some ways they do get some things right, but unfortunately they also get a lot wrong. Future War: Reborn is a game that’s overpriced in my opinion and I think if they’d have started with a lower price out of gate then the problems wouldn’t have been as glaring. When it’s all said and done this game does provide you with some enjoyable moments but the problems are never far behind so for that reason I can’t fully recommend this game to you.",46,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

God of Light: Remastered,Xbox One,Playmous,"['Action', 'General']",E,2017-10-20,"Console game’s that start their life on mobile devices don’t always port very well to consoles and in the end they just have too many problems and that ultimately means that you find little to no enjoyment in the game. Thankfully God of Light: Remastered is a pretty decent port, and whilst it does have some problems I found that I had more enjoyment than frustration. The puzzles in the game have been done really well and without a shadow of a doubt this is where you will find that you will have the most enjoyment. The difficulty curve however will cause you a few problems because it does spike out of nowhere and in my opinion this can make the game lose its appeal slightly. As far as content goes there is a lot for you to sink your teeth into and the amount of levels will keep you busy for quite a while, but I still think the game is overpriced. The reason I say this is because it’s free on mobile devices, so in my opinion a nominal fee would have been better and it wouldn’t put many people off. The mechanics and controls in the game really surprised me because they’ve done a great job of making them feel responsive throughout and you wouldn’t know that this game was originally designed for mobile devices, which is great. The presentation side of the game is something I really enjoyed and the main reason for that was because of the visuals. The visuals in the game have a real atmospheric feel about them and they do a great job of relaxing you allowing you to focus on the gameplay. At the end of the day as far as puzzle games go God of Light: Remastered is a pretty good addition to the genre. It does have a few niggling problems every now and then and it can’t really be played for long periods, but when played in short bursts the game can be really enjoyable and that’s enough for me to give it a good recommendation.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The levels are varied and interesting and the same can be said about the weapons. The game is beautiful, too; I often found myself backing away from the action and just staring at the scenery. It was clear that a lot of work went into this game. The enemies are similar to those of the original 3 games, and the Forerunner enemies are unique and fun to fight. The story is interesting and engaging. You're going to hear a lot of people griping about the story in this game, but chances are, it's because they didn't do their research. It literally takes 10 minutes to learn all the backstory to this game with a few simple web searches. I suck at multiplayer so I'm not going to be much of a help reviewing that. But from what I can tell, Warzone is basically the original Battlefront: you go around a big map killing enemies and capturing command posts until time runs out or you get enough kills or something. It seems fun if you're willing to put the time into it. All in all, I can honestly say that this game deserves a 10/10. Other reviewers will be griping about how 343 Industries is ruining the Halo franchise by trying to make the world different from the original trilogy or whatever, but I really think they're doing a fine job. It's like they think that 343 is bad only because it's not Bungie. When people look back at the old games, they only remember the good things about them. Because why remember the bad, right? Well, because then it would be a fair comparison to 343's games, and we can't have a fair comparison. We're too salty about Halo changing development companies. Well, what I have to say to those people is this: Halo 5: Guardians is damn fun. Get over yourselves.",84,Generally favorable reviews,89.0,12.0,0.0,6.5,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,405.0,738.0,65.0

Thankfully Hammerwatch is a very enjoyable addition to the genre and it does a great job of capturing an old-school feel whilst also maintaining a modern edge to it as well. Obviously the most important thing about a game like this is the hack and slash gameplay and thankfully it delivers in pretty much all areas here. A thing that surprised me a great deal about the game is the amount of content it has and the best thing is that each mode brings something to the table. Without a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is when you play with friends and they’ve also promised to deliver online multiplayer in the near future, which is something I’m really looking forward to. They do have a single player addition as well for you to play with, but when you play on your own things can become repetetive quickly and it’s definitely a lot more difficult when playing on your own. My biggest gripe with the game is that it lacks variety in certain areas and I especially found this to be the case when it came to the level design and enemy design. It does however kinda make up for this by offering a decent amount of variety in the character classes you can choose from, and I must admit that it was a pleasure to try out each different class. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed. Visually the game has a retro feel with modern touches included and the same can be said about the sound design, which is awesome. At the end of the day if you’re a fan of the traditional hack and slash style then you will absolutely adore Hammerwatch. It does have a few shortcomings but you will easily forget about these especially when playing with friends. It manages to nail all the important aspects which makes the game very enjoyable and this puts the game in the very good category when it comes to the hack and slash genre, and for that reason it gets a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hand of Fate 2,Xbox One,Defiant Development,"['Miscellaneous', 'Board / Card Game']",T,2017-12-01,"I was a massive fan of the original Hand of Fate and in a way I thought that the game breathed new life into the RPG formula, so when Hand of Fate 2 was first announed I was really looking forward to it, but I must admit that I didn’t think they could improve much over the first game. To my surprise Hand of Fate 2 has managed to improve in a number of ways over the original and this makes the game a must own in every way. The first improvement you will see is when it comes to the combat, and I was very pleased that they made the combat more fluid and responsive. I would however have liked to have seen a little more variety in the combat. The cards in the game are as good as ever and the best thing is that each card matters, which means no game ever plays the same so you will remain interested and invested for quite a while. The game boasts quite a lot in terms of content and the game does a great job of making you want to carry on so that means you will unlock even more content. Once again the quests in the game have a great variety to them, and the best thing is that each quest is actually a pretty memorable affair. I will say though that quite a lot of the quests are very challenging and this could be off putting to some. The presentation side of the game has seen some significant improvements and this in turn makes the game even more immersive. Don’t get me wrong the visuals and sound design won’t win any awards, but they don’t need to win any awards because they expertly combine together to create a unique experience. At the end of the day Hand of Fate 2 is the perfect sequel and the main reason for that is because it manages to improve in pretty much all areas. If you were fan on the original game then Hand of Fate 2 will be something you absolutely adore and the best thing is that it has even more content for you to get to grips with. Without a shadow of a doubt this game gets a full recommendation from me and I hope the series continues to go from strength to strength.",82,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,1.0,0.0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,0.0,2.0,71.0

HAWKEN,Xbox One,"Reloaded Games Inc., Reloaded Games","['Action', 'General', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Tactical']",T,2016-07-01,"If what you want is to be a lumbering mech stomping through a run down urban environment shooting missiles and storms of bullets at other lumbering mechs then this is the game for you. I played this game on the PC back in 2012 pretty religiously and it feels exactly the same on the Xbox. The controls are a bit hard to get used to since piloting a mech is not the same as a person and you can't remap anything but I found that it's no problem after half an hour. A lot of the gameplay is centered on map awareness, movement, and knowing how to use your specific mech. With over 30 mechs that all fit into some sort of niche in the class based shooter genre (TF2 style), every play style you can imagine is covered. one example would be the Scout mech; fast, hard hitting, and great for harassing the enemy team in urban maps. another would be the brawler; heavily armored with a rapid fire shotgun and rocket launcher, this mech is slow moving but able to move into a bottleneck and push its way through. The Predator is fast, shoots sticky explosives along with a sniperifle and has a special ability to lower incoming damage. Literally everything imaginable is here. I've read some complaintson the Hawken forums from xbox players saying that the graphics are bad, aiming is hard, turning is too slow, and the bots are too jittery but that is all part of the original design of the game. Remember that this is a game from 2012 and the full file size is somwhere around 4.5gb. the aiming is hard because there is no auto aim and every mech can dash in every direction and jump/ float in the air. This is not a twitch shooter like cod, 1v1 fights can last up to 15 seconds of continuous fire if both sides use cover and keeping on target is not something easily done without aim assist.

Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,tinyBuild,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'General', '3D', 'First-Person']",E,2017-12-08,"I liked the game, for having been an interesting project, this time today I will say its positive and negative points.Pros:First of all, its graphics seem fantastic on the Xbox One to be indie. The story itself seems good but unconventional but acceptable. The I.A. I think it's excellent in Act 1 and 2, because the neighbor himself will not leave you alone at those times; the music seems great, giving a sentimental touch in the cinematic.The atmosphere of the game is pleasant, but very functional when played. The gameplay is very fluid and very easy to handle, and it's not a nuisance, as many people say.I see that many say they have a problem with the price of the game, but for me it is a good price compared to the 5 or 6 hours that you must finish and all its secrets (and it is not like the SONIC FORCES that you spend in 3 hours at 100%).Cons:If I have to say it, there have been mistakes, but I have seen that there have not been so many, nor have they been harmful to ruin the experience.The I.A. The third act seems to MEH that the problem is that the neighbor does not seem to find us in the exact places and that he wants a lot to say (maybe the house is too big and that's why he can not find us, that's my idea)There are dubious scenarios and designs, because there is a room in which there is nothing but a grid on the floor and that makes me think that they did not have enough time to finish it.Conclusion:Able to see my review of the game on PC but in this platform I find it fascinating is more fluid and has better quality, also suffers with a few errors and also the same as suffered in PC but still does not ruin your experience, you will have a better time.",42,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,4.0,8.0,4.7,Generally unfavorable reviews,13.0,4.0,17.0,47.0

And ice cream parlors...a golf course...a cemetery...and an underground lab, which holds your primary objective of destroying a dna specific virusThat being said, I found this map to be much more lifeless compared to Paris…while the world if full,it doesn’t really feel like anything is truly going on around you…your targets are just out in the world.. Either hunt them down or lure them to you…This is also the first time I played through an episode on online mode and ran into an issue that many will find frustrating...While playing, the game got disconnected...this disconnection forced me back to the main menu to continue...no big deal, I’ll just hop right back in and finish it offline right?Wrongyou can’t play a file that was saved online while you play offline...so I had to pause my downloads and connect back in to finish this level…And this sucks because you’re practically punished for not playing online, because online play is the only way to level up your character and unlock new starting locations and weapons during the prep stage…Another new flaw highlighted for me is the story…I completely forgot what was going on and lost all interest and connection to the story thanks to decision to release this game episodically...one could argue that telltale games does a great job at getting away with this, and I would argue back, that no.. They don’tEpisodic releases kill urgency and care unless the episodes are somewhat self-contained much like the walking dead season 1 episodes... rather than a small chunk of an overarching story like we see heremuch like every other episodic gameWhile Hitman Sapienza is gorgeous and full of new things for you to do, and opportunities to play with…This episodic nonsense is getting in the way of what could potentially be an awesome story…I give Hitman Sapienzaa 7.5/10",79,Generally favorable reviews,5.0,2.0,0.0,6.5,Mixed or average reviews,13.0,3.0,8.0,65.0

There is no spot without dozens of people around…I also found that there are no real moments in this level that spark your imagination of possibility to take advantage of an npcs situation like the past 2 maps have been crawling with..I found that the only way to get through this map was to kill and run, come back for my disguise later or simply ignore the opportunities and attempt to sneak past everyone and get inside someway other than the front doorBut once you do finally sneak into the area one of your targets are in, youll find that each of the 2 areas are pretty enclosed and void of any organic lifejust your standard buildings with guards and soldiers walking aroundThe gameplay is also starting to become quite repetitive…Like the developers have already run out of ideas to distract or bring someone into a room and were only about halfway through releases.While Marrakesh is definitely a beautiful level and a different animal for stealth fans to try and tameI found it to be the least imaginative map yet.I give Hitman Marrakesh a 6/10",0,No score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,7.0,3.0,1.0,74.0

It was a long time coming, (waiting for this game), but the months of anticipation have been beyond worth it. Here is my succinct review for this gem. HLD throws you, the drifter, head first into a vibrant, mysterious world. You wake up from some slumber to find a post-apocalyptic land flooded with gorgeous, neon-painted landscapes and scenery, made possible by some freaking fantastic pixel artistry. You begin to wander the land, still totally unaware of who you are or why you're here, until you stumble upon the contrasting elements to this world's eye-grabbing visuals. A vile, destructive disease has poisoned your heart, and innocent land dwellers have been slaughtered by dreadful barbaric wars. If that weren't enough, some dark, sinister force seems intent on either killing you, maliciously toying with your soul, or both. And so begins your journey. From here, you'll talk to villagers through pictographs (no words are ever spoken) and hear their tragic accounts. You'll stop by the local upgrade shops with their neat cryptic language to get a sneak peek at your later, stronger self. When you head out in one of four cardinal directions, you'll begin to master your sword, your pistol, and - of course - your dash/drift. You'll encounter numerous enemies of varying size, race, and attacks, and with every death, you'll understand how to outsmart them on the next life. This game is intriguing, and so terribly satisfying. Finding secrets, beating bosses, buying upgrades, you feel awesome. The combat is challenging, but incredibly rewarding. When you clear out a large room and just barely survive, there's a sense of accomplishment that says: ""You earned this."" And to top it all off, through the entire experience, a gorgeous soundtrack by one of gaming's best (Disasterpiece) immerses you in this universe of light, death, and hope. I cannot recommend this game enough.

INVERSUS Deluxe,Xbox One,Hypersect,"['Action', 'Arcade']",E,2017-10-04,"INVERSUS Deluxe is one of them games that is perfect for when you have a few friends over, and I must admit that I had an incredible amount of fun when playing it this way. Unfortunately though it’s not as fun when playing alone and that could put some people off. The game has managed to get all the basics spot on, and that’s evident straight away with the controls. The controls are responsive throughout and retain a fast and tight feeling whenever you play a game. This is very important because the game will test your reflexes a lot, and I found the reflex gameplay to be very good in design and it also gave off a unique feel. There are a number of maps for you to play on and each map is very cleverly designed. The variety in the maps keeps things fresh and each game you play feels completely different, which is great. I was very surprised to see an online option included, and I must admit that I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately though the online side of the game doesn’t always work well and matchmaking can take a considerable amount of time to complete. The presentation side of the game may be basic but I absolutely loved it. The black and white visual style works very well for the game and it definitely enhances the gameplay whilst also feeling unique at the same time. At the end of the day if you don’t like multiplayer games then you won’t get the full enjoyment from INVERSUS Deluxe. It does cater for the single player experience, but it often feels a little bit difficult and rather frustrating when played this way. When played with friends though the game is absolutely brilliant, and it manages to create a fun experience with a lot of replay value going for it. If you look past the niggling problems then you find a game that’s very fun and kinda different, so in my opinion I recommend that you give the game a try.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Sometimes could be hard , but it's because you need to find the correct approach to knock down the objectives.But I don't want to spoil anything , you have to figure it out by yourself. Maybe some missions are a bit longer than they should be or a bit hard but it isn't a big deal afterallit' about 20$ so I really don't find any reason at all ,if you like action flight games as Blazing Angels or Crimson Skies to not buy this game",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.3,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,1.0,2.0,63.0

It's Quiz Time,Xbox One,Snap Finger Click Ltd,"['Miscellaneous', 'Trivia / Game Show']",E,2017-12-15,"Quiz game’s do a great job of creating quality family time and if done right they can be an incredible amount of fun. Thankfully It’s Quiz Time does that down to a tee and the best thing is that you can easily look past its imperfections because of that. The amount of questions the game has to offer is fantastic and it also offers you a number of categories so it’s very rare that you get the same question often, which is great. The game also offers you a decent amount of modes for you to sink your teeth into and the Live Show mode is very fun and has a huge amount of potential. The single player offering the game has is okay but things do become boring when playing this way, so without a doubt the best way to get the most out of the game is when playing with friends and family. The only problem I suffered with when playing this game is when the companion app didn’t always respond to the answers I put in, so a little work could be put in here. I would also like to here less from the host because she does start getting on your nerves quite quickly. Some people however may like the corny jokes that she delivers and I must commend the developers here because they do ever so well in making it accessible to all gamers. The presentation side of the game is pretty good in my opinion, especially when it came to the visuals. The visuals are fun and easy on the eye and in a way they enhance your experience with the game, which is a very good added bonus. At the end of the day as far as quiz game’s go It’s Quiz Time is a very good addition to the genre. Don’t get me wrong it isn’t a game that you’re going to play all of the time, but it is a game that is perfect for party’s and gatherings. It’s a game that never takes itself too seriously and most important of all it offers you a fun and enjoyable experience for player’s of all ages and when everything is all said and done it gets a big thumbs up from me and my family.",0,No score yet,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
Ittle Dew 2,Xbox One,Nicalis,"['Role-Playing', 'General', 'Action RPG']",E10+,2016-11-15,"Ludosity and Nicalis have just released ittle Dew 2, a fun, engaging and totally addictive adventure game.  Ittle and her side kick Tippsie have washed ashore on a strange island on their flimsy raft.  As with all great adventure stories, the raft breaks and our hero must use their wits and strength to battle evil and find enough supplies to build a new raft and float off into the sunset.Ittle Dew 2 harkens back to the original days of The Legend of Zelda.  You will have to fight your way through more than half a dozen dungeons to grab new weapons and pieces for your escape boat.  Besides searching dungeons full of monsters and puzzles you will also seek out dozens of hidden caves that will contain health power ups and more useful items for your quest.Don't let the cute cartoon look, or wacky story line fool you.  This game is not going to be a cake walk.  Every dungeon has a short cut - if you have the right equipment to access them.  You will also have to do some serious thinking when it comes to solving the puzzles in the game.  They will tax your brain and only get more devious as you progress.  The optional dungeons will make sure that you are at your best.  All you have to do to gain access to the optional dungeons is search out special pieces of scrap.  Once you have gathered enough of them you can open new paths.The graphics in the game lean a bit on the cartoony side, but they are excellent.  When you first look at the game, it will seem like it is for younger ages, but laying beneath the cutesy exterior is a substantal game that will test all adventurers.  The game features a real questing soundtrack filled with jaunty tunes to accompany you in your journey.  I can't be certain, but a few of the tracks sound like they have an electric accordian on them, and this is not a bad thing.ittle Dew 2 is an involved adventure game that will make Zelda fans forget for a while that the new game is months away.  The variety of enemies, the distint areas for you to explore, and the fact that you can tackle dungeons in any order will keep you busy for hours.  The game is available now on XBox One, PS4 and Steam for $19.99",72,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,0.0,1.0,8.8,Generally favorable reviews,3.0,1.0,0.0,88.0
Jeopardy!,Xbox One,Ubisoft,"['Miscellaneous', 'Trivia / Game Show']",E,2017-11-07,"It’s been a long time since I played a Jeopardy game, in fact you have to go back to 2003 since I last played it. I remember back then that I enjoyed it quite a bit, and thankfully there is some enjoyment to be had with its newest installment. The enjoyment though unfortunately doesn’t last very long and without a doubt it’s best enjoyed with friends instead of being played alone. There are a huge number of questions for you to answer and I think they have a decent array of questions, which is always important in a game like this. I was also impressed with the amount of modes the game has and the best thing is that each mode has a decent amount of variety going for it, which in turn gives the game some much needed replay value. I will say however that the game doesn’t have enough content to justify its price tag, and this rather expensive price will definitely put quite a few people off. I must say I was expecting a lot more from the online multiplayer that’s included in the game, but unfortunately it has too many problems and the biggest problem is that it suffers greatly with matchmaking issues which is a shame because they’ve done a very good job of making it accessible to all gamers. The presentation side of the game is very disappointing and I was expecting a lot more. The biggest problem with the presentation side of the game is that it doesn’t look or sound anything like the real show, which in turn ultimately hurts the game’s immersion considerably. At the end of the day if you like a good quiz game then you will find some enjoyment with this version of Jeopardy, but I would definitely recommend that you wait for the price to go down because there isn’t enough to justify the price it’s currently at. Without a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is with friends because it’s no where near as fun when playing on your own. Jeopardy ultimately does just enough to get a recommendation from me, but in my opinion there are better games in the genre for you to play.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

JumpJet Rex,Xbox One,TreeFortress Games,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2016-04-29,"JumpJet Rex is from TreeFortress Games, and published by Loot Interactive. It gets its basic gameplay from 8 and 16 bit platformers from years ago, but instead of just jumping, you are a dinosaur with jets for shoes.  Apparently millions of years ago dinosaurs invented space travel. The story starts with Rex being told an Asteroid is heading toward earth, and him being a 'Dinonaut', he must travel into space to stop it. The Good The adventure mode in the game contains 40+ levels, with each one taking around a minute or less to complete. Some levels take longer, but each level has three objectives: Finish the level, don't die, and beat the level under part time. You can usually cruise through the level the first time through, to get to know the layout, then try again to not die, or complete it in under par time. Some experts may be able to do all three in one go, but once you obtain a star for something, you don't have to get it again. You traverse each level using a series of moves, and each move helps you complete the level in a speedy way. The basic move, the jump, propels you up using the jets on your shoes, this can be repeatedly pressed to get you where you need to go by pressing A. You can also press X to launch forward, which helps you navigate tight spaces, and quickly go through rings. Finally, you can hold Y, which will send you up as long as you are hold it. The combination of these moves, and the mastery of them is required to complete the levels and obtain the stars. You can go through the game by yourself, or with the help of a couch co-op partner. The best thing about co-op is that you don't die unless both of you get hit. When one player gets hit, a 5 second timer starts. As long as the other player doesn't get hit during that 5 seconds, both players return to normal. While in the 5 second cooldown, the hit player cannot go through the rings required to complete the level. After each set of 10 or so levels, there is a boss level. Just like any old school game, you need to learn the patterns, and what you need to do to beat the boss, then they are relatively easy to beat. Most of the bosses can be completed quickly, and they repeat the same two or three moves until their health bar is depleted. If you obtain all 3 stars on the boss levels, something special is unlocked. Along with the adventure mode, JumpJet Rex also includes a RageQuit mode, which only gives you 3 lives, and no checkpoints, and a speedrun mode, which is a condensed version of the game. These modes would be recommended to play only once you have completed adventure mode with all stars, so you are familiar with the levels. The Bad I don't have many complaints about this game, but it does have a big difficulty spike towards the end. You are also required to play through each level multiple times in order to unlock stars, because later levels are not unlocked unless you obtain a certain number of stars. The levels all start to bleed together toward the end of the game, as you are doing the same 3 objectives the entire game. At least the levels are short, but the variation in terrain is limited. The Achievements About half of the achievements in the game are either story related, or basic level objectives. This means the average player could unlock half of the achievements just bu completing the game on normal, and do some minor achievement cleanup on specific level objectives. The rest of the achievements are either tied to collectibles: obtaining all stars, coins, and hidden items, or are speedrun related. Most of the achievements seem doable with some practice, but all but the most dedicated players will most likely attempt them. Final Verdict JumpJet Rex is a fun game, but has no real story, but it doesn't really need one. You are a dinosaur in space trying to stop an asteroid...what more story can you expect? Couch co-op is nice to have, as most games these days leave it out. If you love platformers, you will enjoy this game, and if not, you may still like it anyway. I had fun going through the levels, but not sure I will ever be able to complete all of the achievements. At $9.99, this seems like a good deal, especially for those that like old school style games.",0,No score yet,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Knock-Knock,Xbox One,Ice-Pick Lodge,"['Miscellaneous', 'General']",T,2017-08-23,"There is a wooden house standing in the thick of the forest. A single man resides there. As of late the house is visited by unusual Guests which knock on the window shutters inviting the hermit to take part in a game of hide-and-seek. The winning condition is simple, you have to remain alive and to retain your sanity till sunrise. This means that approaching the Visitors head-on might be a terrible idea. There is an unusual cabin deep in the woods. It had served as a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers. But as of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings; things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of the woods. Come night, it seems like someone's made himself at home in the twilight of rooms, attics, and cellars. You need to stay awake and sane till dawn. The Lodger is wandering the rooms, evading the unknown, counting minutes till morning. But it's only in the night that he can solve the main puzzle and find the answers. What's going on? Are the Guests real, ot are they just figments of his insomniac imagination? What'd happened to the forest? What's happening to the cabin? Is there a line between reality and imagination? In late November, 2011, a strange and troubling event has happened to our studio. We have received an anonymous e-mail which suggested that we should produce some ""unconventional"" game based upon the materials attached to the letter. Such offers are a dime a dozen and most of the time they barely deserve any attention at all, however, this one seemed quite different. The attachment contained a set of 19 files added to an archive titled ""lestplay"". The files (snippets of text, scraps of audio recording, video footage fragments) as well as the style and wording of the message itself appeared to be rather disturbing. The surface examination did not reveal anything straightforwardly terrifying, yet we could not escape the feeling that something truly sinister was lurking underneath. The stranger was begging us to complete the project he has started, yet he also made us well aware of the risk we took as the proposed ludic situation would potentially explain what calamity befell whoever has compiled the ominous archive, thus urging ourselves to meet the same fate. The unknown Author was a gentleman and a scholar - he stated that he would introduce no boundaries to our creative freedom, yet he insisted that along with the ludic situation itself the items forming the ""lestplay"" archive should be included into the game, ""else everything would be futile"". Alongside a significant number of others, we tend to lend a certain amount of credibility to mysticism, yet this specific predicament seemed more like a shoddy mystification. We were fed up with a massive number of similar ""cursed files"" tricks and at times we felt inclined to erase the whole thing for good. However, upon consideration, we still decided to take part in this experiment. At the very least we would find out what the result would be, and what awful fate would possibly await us, as we will obviously be the first people to play the game. -Hide! Play hide-and-seek with denizens of your nightmares.-Don't look now! The goal of each night is to reach dawn while still sane.-Fill in the gaps. The house aids the Lodger. You only have to fix it up and keep it in order.-Seek. The Lodger has lost something very important. The reason for what is happening is somewhere inside. Everything that is happening can be explained, you only need to find the key and bring it to light.-Wait. In this game you need to watch and listen carefully. Inspect and scrutinize. You only have to last until the sunrise.-Follow the rules of the game! Of course you must first understand the game being played with you.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Lies Of Astaroth,Xbox One,iFree Studio,"['Miscellaneous', 'Board / Card Game']",T,2016-08-12,"Lies Of Astaroth follows a long-standing tradition for F2P games that we've seen since the boom in mobile gaming.  If you've played Rage Of Bahamut or Fantasica, you may notice that the main draw seems to be the anime-style visuals.  I'll admit that I'm a sucker for cute art and these gals are scantily-clad so they're definitely going for that appeal..  Throw in the CCG mechanics and you have a solid foundation. It seems the critics have slammed this game because it is a grind to get anything done.  Well, that's what one would expect from this genre.  You'll have to logon daily or spend money to be truly effective.  The sad part with this model is that it limits the player base and the long-term earnings.  I really wish F2P game developers would learn this by now but they continue to create these paywall-heavy games.  *facepalm* That said, this game is nowhere as bad as the Mobage games.  I still play Fantasica casually and that game very clearly makes every event a pay-to-win scenario, with players needing to spend at least $10 in order to compete but, really, $100 if they want the top prizes.  At $100, you get a 50/50 shot at the most legendary loot. The virtual economy in Lies Of Astaroth seems much more reasonable.  You can get a started pack for 10K and they start you with around 200K - that's 20 packs worth of loot!  The starter packs have cards ranging from one to three stars, which means you won't get any of the amazeballs 4 or 5-star cards.  You can also exchange tickets, which randomly drop, for a 3 to 5-star card (also, you start with 10).  The premium currency, crystals, cost around $6 per 280-320 batches. Pay careful attention to the price per unit as, sometimes, you save more with the smaller purchases.  While Lies Of Astaroth does a good job rewarding you for your dedication, an opportunity most ""free"" to play games miss, they do make a $400/40000 crystal package available to boot.  I'm sure the insane mobile game addicts will drop much each month or week.  Again, that's the issue: you can't have a sustainable business model where only 1-10% of your player base is spending real money consistently. Now, while the money stuff is always important to consider in these F2P games, what's really important to note is the fun factor and skill cap.  This game is quite accessible as you can auto-battle if you're feeling lazy or control the battle if you want to do specific strats.  When you first start off, the type of combos and ""micro"" you can pull off is quite limited so auto-battle will be best.  In this manner, the game is a bit more on-rails like, say, Bad Blood (a little-known CCG that I quite enjoy, even if it's very ""basic""). What this means is that you don't have to be a card battle pro to jump in.  Even better, the Xbox One version seems limited to singleplayer at the moment so you won't have to worry about PvP and battling against big spenders, which is something that really ruins F2P games IMHO.  Hopefully, when they implement PvP, they'll set up brackets according to spending.  No one wants to invest any time or money into a game that is ""pay to win"". That leads me to the next consideration: skill cap.  Better yet, is LoA more skill or luck-driven?  I haven't put enough time in to comment on that but I do notice that some cards have effects that trigger randomly.  Drops are random, too, so there's at least a big of RNG to consider.  Theoretically, if you have inferior cards but play them right, you should be able to win.  From what I've seen, the AI opponents have some sweet cards but you can keep pace due to the ""cost curve"" mechanics.  In short, opponents can't simply drop OP cards on you due to cost restrictions.  That means that you can likely win using agro decks  like you would in Hearthstone, perhaps. Deck management is interesting.  You start off with three slots, with additional slots unlocking at Level 3 and up.  Basically, the more time you put in, the more diverse your decks can become.  You can have up to 10 decks, with your 10th deck slot unlocking at Level 95.  You're also limited on overall deck cost, with the cap at 16 and the average card costing 3 points to play. Fans of card games will be happy to know that the effects on the cards are actually interesting.  Even the low-rarity cards have multiple effects that synergize well with others.  While a lot of it is generic, if not formulaic, there is quality there and enough to keep you engaged with deckbuilding at least. A few more things to note: the BGM is rather generic and annoying.  Bring your own music.  The menu system is clean and easy to follow.  Don't forget to go to the Mission menu to collect rewards.  I reckon those will come in handy!

Lightfield,Xbox One,Lost in the Garden,"['Racing', 'Arcade', 'Futuristic']",E,2017-09-26,"Lightfield is one of them classic games that has a very good core concept, but unfortunately it has nothing else. I appreciate the effort they have put in to make their game feel unique, but you come away from the game feeling bored and at times you don’t really want to return. It’s not all doom and gloom though because the physics and omnidirectional mechanic have been done really well, and it can be fun attaching yourself to various surfaces at the start. Unfortunately though the gameplay does get repetitive quickly, and the lack of content really doesn’t help this. Every game mode in the game feels the same and the lack of variety makes the replay value very low. The tracks in the game are actually very cleverly designed and I like how you can find shortcuts here and there, but unfortunately there are only seven tracks for you to enjoy. The movement in the game can be quite awkward at times and it didn’t feel that the controls always remained responsive, which isn’t great in a game like this. The game can also be quite difficult at times and you never feel like you’re going to catch up because there always seems to be a linear route despite it being open-world. My favourite thing about the game was definitely the presentation. Visually the space and futuristic look can look awesome at times, and it really does do a great job of making the gameplay stand out. I was also a fan of the soundtrack and I think the relaxing music fits the style very well. At the end of the day Lightfield could have been a lot better in my opinion, and it definitely never reaches its full potential. They do have some interesting ideas in play here, but unfortunately the lack of content and the niggling problems it has will be really the only thing you remember. The price of the game is quite steep and I can only recommend the game when it lowers quite a bit in price.",65,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0

Lilith-M,Xbox One,"E-Home Entertainment Development Co., Ltd","['Puzzle', 'Action']",E,2017-09-27,"As far as puzzle games go Lilith-M is not a bad addition to the genre. It has some interesting and unique ideas, and it would have been even better if they would have ironed out the few niggling problems the game has. The main crux in a puzzle game is obviously the puzzles, and thankfully the puzzles here are very good. Some of the puzzles are very creative and require some thought to complete, which makes the puzzles that little bit more interesting. The controls in the game don’t always help with the puzzles though because at times they feel a little fiddly and they don’t always feel responsive, which is definitely frustrating. They have though thrown in a unique idea to make you forget about its shortcomings, and in my opinion they have implemented controlling two characters very well and this makes the game stand out. I would however have liked more of a story to accompany these two characters and I think they’ve missed out on an opportunity here. The level design in the game has a decent amount of variety going for it and they’ve got more than enough levels for you to sink your teeth into. I must admit that I didn’t get bored much when playing the different levels, which is always a bonus. The presentation side of the game is a bit hit and miss. I enjoyed the visuals in the game and I think the steam-punk art style gives the game a lot of character. The sound design is unfortunately not as good and there is nothing memorable that stands out here. At the end of the day Lilith-M isn’t going to win any awards, but what it does do is that it offers you a fun and enjoyable time with some interesting and clever puzzles. The few problems it has can hold the game back somewhat, but it has more going for it than against it and in the end it gets a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Little Nightmares,Xbox One,Tarsier Studios,"['Action Adventure', 'General', 'Linear']",T,2017-04-28,"Before I begin this semi-review, semi-not-a-review post in earnest, allow me to state the obvious: you’re undoubtedly going to hear Little Nightmares in the same conversations you hear about Limbo and Inside in some ways. Ignore that chatter. Little Nightmares my strike some similar chords to what Playdead has done with their past titles, however it is in no way striking the same tone or note in what experiences it attempts to convey. Yes, there are the similar tropes that come with dark games and brooding environments featuring dire and grotesque consequences for any unwary and unwelcome traveler. There are ultimately gruesome ends your adorable character can meet and plenty of equally gruesome foes to send her there. Environmental hazards and puzzles come in equal numbers and the mere use of light and darkness is more than enough to set the tone for each stage of the short yet endearing exploration. If you’re into platforming puzzle titles that also feature palpable amounts of ambiance and relevant horrors and low-key fears that will probably make you cringe once you realize the extent of their depth and attention to detail, then Little Nightmares will rock your socks off. Or knock them off and freeze you with fear. Perhaps the most exciting component in the game is that it leaves pretty much everything except what you see with your own eyes quite ambiguous in an almost ‘Souls’ sort of way (of handling lore)- minus the bloody scratch marks on the ground everywhere. Ambiguity permeates the entire experience and makes it a more convincing and exceptionally interesting one for that matter. You aren’t even given so much as maybe the occasional hint to rotate the camera around if you get stuck, however the rest of the controls are never exactly specified and so it’s up to you to learn the ropes. The experience perfectly meshes both two-dimensional and three-dimensional perspective into a very well thought out 2.5D platforming puzzler. Although you are very definitely little and dwarfed by the surroundings you will encounter, there is nothing little at all about the immense nightmarish rogues you will inevitably face or flee. Because you cannot fight back in most cases, there is always an air of tension and terror whenever these foes enter the picture and you must fly through some puzzle or another and make it to the next area. I’m still quite shocked at how well thought out each room is and how each area ratchets up the tension and the screen literally crawls with the sound effects and slight background happenings as well. Little Nightmares is a game that will easily catch you if you pay too much attention to your surroundings, but will ironically let you escape its clutches time and time again should you not find yourself entirely caught up in the warped reality it presents. For the most part the puzzle and platform gameplay never gets too difficult and so the entire experience is perfectly accessible, enjoyable, and entirely worthwhile in my opinion. The presentation itself will pique your curiosity and then the events themselves, as they unfold, should firmly grasp it and drag you into the experience. The vivid imagery and scenes steal the show almost when coupled with the eerie and daunting soundtrack accompaniment. Oftentimes you may stumble onto a new area and not even notice the body dangling from a rope overhead with its feet just barely visible or the faint outline of a shadow shuffling hurriedly in the background. It’s the moments like that that add to the feeling that someone is always watching and that every skittering motion on screen is some new devilish foe come to rend your flesh or curdle your blood. Needless to say, Little Nightmares isn’t your typical horror game and it’s much better for that fact. Ambiguity is the name of the game and the game itself will wear you out each and every time you think you’ve understood its nature- right up until the very end. You can feel free to stop and stare at the beautiful surroundings any time, however it still has a relatively run time and as such is a compact and entirely artistic and expressive experience. If I were to apply my typical review material and run down the brief checklist of everything I tend to go through in those lengthy posts, Little Nightmares would be getting no less than a 9.5 out of 10 from me. It’s entirely deserving of that and a highly replayable experience if only to see the little touches that you’ll pick up with each runthrough here and there.",83,Generally favorable reviews,20.0,2.0,0.0,7.8,Generally favorable reviews,27.0,7.0,5.0,78.0

Little Triangle,Xbox One,Dreamoji,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2018-02-07,"I love indie games that try to mix different genre’s into their gameplay, and when done correctly you end up having a great time with that said game. Little Triangle implements this style in its gameplay and doesn’t always come off it definitely gets a lot more right than it gets wrong. They have done a great job of making its gameplay accessible to all gamers because it’s easy to pick up and play and it also carries with it a challenging side to it as well. The game in my opinion is best enjoyed when played solo or 2 player co-op. More friends? Well the battle royale mode is a fantastic addition and it does give the game a lot of replayability. Unfortunately the game doesn’t offer much more in terms of content, so I would recommend playing the game in short bursts because it does become repetetive when playing for long periods. There are quite a few levels to go through however and I must admit that I was impressed with the amount of variety each level had. Unfortunately the same can’t be said about the amount of variety the enemies have and facing some enemies over and over again can become tedious. The controls which are obviously very important in a game like this have thankfully been done to perfection. Everything feels fast and fluid throughout and most important of all every aspect remains responsive throughout which makes the platforming very enjoyable. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed and in my opinion the simplicity of things works in its favour. Visually the game is crisp and colorful and without a doubt the visuals carry a certain charm. The same could also be said about the sound design and thankfully the different sounds never got on my nerves, which is great. At the end of the day I love little games that try and punch above their weight and that’s exactly what Little Triangle does. Yes the game may have a few shortcomings here and there, but on the whole they’ve got the most important aspects spot on which makes the game a very enjoyable affair. Each different mechanic in the game plays an important part in the overall scheme of things and they certainly took a risk by doing this, but the risk ultimately paid off. For fans of platformers this is a must play game and when everything is said and done it does more than enough to get two thumbs up from me...",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Lock's Quest,Xbox One,Digital Continue,"['Strategy', 'Real-Time', 'Defense']",,2017-05-30,"I bought this game because I remembered playing it on Nintendo DS as a kid and thought it would be fun to give it a chance. I remembered this game being hard and boy did I remember right. This game has no difficult setting and is pretty inconsistent in difficulty. Even some of the earliest levels in this game are pretty hard and you will fail multiple time. The game overall does get harder which becomes a problem later because some levels are too hard and I've even become stuck on one. after putting over 5 hours into one level and still being unable to pass it I've kinda given up. On top of the difficulty the game does have issues of crashing and just stop working at time. When you fail a level it'll give you 3 options. Retry the wave, reset the buildings for that wave, or reset the entire level. Occasionally the game will glitch and won't allow you to click any options forcing you to exit out of the game. The game also has a tendency to crash sometime. I got an average of 1 crash for maybe every 3 hours of gameplay. Not a huge issue but for a game so un-intense it shouldn't have this problem. The repair mechanic which is pretty important also is very hit or miss when it works. often it just won't work at all allowing the enemies to break through and making me lose. While i have complained for most of this review the gameplay is actually fun when it's working properly. And if the game was not $20 and somewhere between $5-10 I would recommend it.

A civil rights leader is murdered while investigating local sheriff, Walter “Slim” Beaumont. Other activists are next on the list – and it’s up to Lincoln and Roxy Laveau (daughter of Charles “The Voice” Laveau) to get to the bottom of what’s happening. As for Sinclair Parish – it may be fictional, but it’s based upon how a few towns used to be, says Hangar 13’s Narrative Director, Bill Harms.  It’s a place where some folks tried to preserve a narrow-minded way of life.  Minorities weren’t welcome, especially after dark. “Just like the main game, we wanted to capture a snapshot of a specific time and place in American history, and let the player experience it.” Since Sinclair Parish is a small rural township in the countryside near the Bayou, expect lots of opportunities to tear through turns, jump gaps and run from the law. Harms adds, “The gameplay is really centered around driving and pushing that as far as possible, while also feeling like a natural extension of the free racing DLC we released not too long ago.” [2K Games]",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

MagNets: Fully Charged,Xbox One,Total Monkery,"['Action', 'General']",E10+,2016-03-11,"Coming from UK studio Total Monkery, MagNets: Fully Charged is an arcade style collect-athon where you control a small robot called Faraday tasked with saving Polarity City from the Bloxbots. Using your MagNet, an electro-magnetic net you can stun & destroy the attacking Bloxbots collecting their scrap to put in a recycling machine that then spits out an item required to progress in the level. Upgraded significantly from its original release on Steam, it’s retro look is appealing to the eyes & the gameplay easy to get into. Early tutorials give you the basics, you cast your net using the trigger buttons, this extends from behind you but has limited range. Stun or destroy enemies (depending on how many times they have already been caught in the net), collect the scrap then repeat. It’s a formula that has very little variation unfortunately. The game is very easy at first…you’ll fly through the first 2 zones of which there are 4 with 5 levels in each. The Factory is when things finally get a bit tougher requiring you to become a bit adept with the dash & slam moves. These can get you out of trouble in a pinch but most of the game will just see you running, casting a net then running some more. It’s these later levels where the game massively improves, urgency is needed & much more skill to survive the relentless attacks of the Bloxbots. The enemies only ever really become a threat when you find yourself surrounded by many but a quick slam can see you away to safety quickly. Faraday’s speed far outmatches the Bloxbots so running circles around them while casting nets is the sensible way to survive. Standing still for too long in this game will not only see you take damage but scatter your collected scrap around forcing you to pick it up again. It’s repetitive but addictive too, it’s the kind of game where you tell yourself you’re just going to do one more level but keep carrying on. The main story can be completed in a handful of hours depending upon your skill level but where the game really comes alive is in its challenge mode. Timed challenges spread across all the levels offering a more intense experience, easily my favourite part of the game. There are a different types of robots to unlock which adds a bit more replay value to the overall package but it’s not going to hold your attention for very long. The game does suffer from a few visual bugs & roughness, nothing game-breaking thankfully. The level designs are a mixed bunch, a bright & colourful world but with some levels lacking inventiveness. The music is well worth praising though, retro & catchy as hell. It fits the game perfectly and some of the later levels really capture the desperation you’ll feel as you try to survive the relentless attacks of the Bloxbots. Unfortunately the mutli-player side of the game is currently unavailable, going to be included in a free update soon. Local co-op/competitive modes will be a great addition to the game & when it is available will probably knock the final score up by a point or so. Overall: 6/10 The simple arcade gameplay is addictive & fun but the lack of variety, lack of available multi-player (currently) & visual bugs hurt the overall package.",49,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,4.0,5.0,4.1,Generally unfavorable reviews,1.0,3.0,3.0,41.0

Maize,Xbox One,Finish Line Games,"['Adventure', 'General']",T,2017-09-12,"Some experiences are best approached with little to no knowledge of them. Having your expectations turned upside down by what unfolds can be very powerful, and is one of the more enjoyable feelings you can witness. That was certainly the case with a game pertaining to some sentient corn – while I had seen things here and there regarding it, the opening left me with a feeling of unease, which was soon turned to laughs. Maize starts off with you regaining your consciousness as a few stalks of corn walk away from you. You start to walk through a corn maze (or maize, depending on how punny you want to be) and soon realize this is a walking simulator. You begin to question whether that corn was real or just your imagination. As you explore the environment, you’ll come across boxes that block your path. After collecting enough items and using them where you are supposed to, certain boxes will disappear and you’ll be notified a path has been opened. These serve as a nice way of keeping you contained in an area with the pieces you either need to find or use. While you will likely have to backtrack through areas to pick everything up that’s relevant, the game does a nice job of outlining items that you can interact with, making sure that you don’t spend hours looking for that secret compartment in the wall. In addition to usable items, you’ll find a fair amount of collectibles with humorous narrative attached to each, assuming you read. And once you finish the first puzzle you are given (several things must be done prior – but it’s the first one you will see), the game does something most walking simulators avoid: NPCs are introduced. The ears of corn are indeed sentient, and have quite the personalities. It’s also here that you are truly introduced to Bob and Ted, the scientists that are more or less behind all of this. Learning about them is completely optional, as they communicate via sticky notes to one another, but I’d recommend it as it’s a fun exchange between the two. Think Pinky & The Brain, with one having absolutely no idea what he’s doing while the other has to clean up the other’s mess. As you progress in here, you’ll come across new characters, and a new reason to be doing what you’re doing. You’ll meet Vladdy, a stuffed bear that will follow and assist you in your travels, while also putting you down every chance he gets. You’ll be put into several precarious situations, and potentially die if you don’t do them correctly. Is your brain bigger than that of a teddy bear and corn? Hopefully. But as with most adventure titles, the puzzles can be a bit obtuse and cause strain. The game plays well enough; with the items you can interact with being highlighted as previously mentioned. Chances are there will be a lot of trial and error when it comes to the items and what they are to be combined with, much like point-and-click adventures. Sadly, you won’t be given funny narrative if the items don’t go together, but you’ll get a decent dose from other portions of the game. Whether that is from the non-usable items you pick up, or the narrator’s silent exposition as things progress in the story, there’s a decent amount of absurdist humor here. The game has plenty of faults though. Nothing that couldn’t be managed, but they are frustrating nonetheless. There are certain areas I’d get stuck in – and I mean physically stuck. It’d be one thing if I couldn’t move at all, but it’s another when the path you are supposed to take has an invisible wall that won’t go away unless you restart. What’s disheartening is I didn’t know I had to go that way, and backtracked several times to see if there was an alternate route. What’s more frustrating is that this wasn’t a one-time thing, as it happened in several areas. The nicest was a ventilation shaft, as that only meant a couple minutes of checking my options before turning it off. Maize has its fair share of humor, and it certainly offers a fun experience for those that enjoy walking simulators, although I can’t say this is the best one that I’ve played. In fact, the humor in this is one of its standout reasons to play, and what sets it apart from so many others in the genre. While it doesn’t always hit, and the absurdist humor can be an acquired taste, I believe it takes well. If it weren’t for all the technical issues I ran into, which will likely be fixed with patches, it’s a fun entry in the blooming genre.",66,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Mantis Burn Racing,Xbox One,VooFoo Studios,"['Racing', 'Arcade', 'Automobile']",E,2016-10-12,"Il y a longtemps que l'on fait des jeux de course vus du dessus, depuis l'époque où sur Amiga par exemple sévissaient les Supercars qui chiaient des mines sur leurs concurrents ou bien le très connu Micromachines évidemment. C'est un genre devenu cependant une niche à jeux indés -et encore- avec des résultats très inégaux. Mofo Studios s'est penché sur la question et a donc délivré en 2016 son Mantis Burn Racing jouable en multi évidemment mais aussi et surtout dans une longue campagne solo assez bien faite qui gère l'évolution des véhicules du joueur via leur achat, leurs améliorations et les points d'expérience gagnés à chaque épreuve.

Les revêtements vont de l'asphalte à la piste en terre mais généralement les **** salopiauds dérapent copieusement, un point très réussi de ce petit jeu d'arcade qui ne souffre d'aucun défaut de maniabilité. Le jeu est d'ailleurs très joli, surtout avec la patch Xbox One Enhanced qui délivre un 4K/60 des plus mignons, hormis très rarement -et inexplicablement- un ralentissement ou deux lorsque l'IA dézingue trop de barrières d'un coup (?!)...

Your girlfriend has broken up with you because of your attitude, and when you try to get her ro reconsider you get hit by a truck.  Since you have not been the nicest of people, you get a one way ticket straight to Hell.  You are greeted by Death himself who decides to make you a deal.

Everything from basic hygiene, getting dressed, driving to work and of course doing your job is on the agenda.  The mechanics are easy to learn, and don't require you to totally master them in order to beat most of the 8 stages.  Unfortunately the final stage amps up the difficulty to a level that takes the fun out of the game.  The quirky mechanics make the final battle a spotlight in tedium.

In this mode you will get medals based on how well you do.  You can also play through story mode with a friend in co-op mode as well.The game has very cartoony graphics, because that is probably the best way to showcase a re-animated corpse in a fun way.

Marble Void,Xbox One,Leveled Games,"['Action', 'Platformer', '3D']",E,2017-10-03,"There aren’t many of these types of games in the market, so it’s always nice to see a different type of game entering the fray. Unfortunately though Marble Void will not be remembered fondly because it simply has too many shortcomings. The controls which of course are very important in a game like this are very awkward and the biggest sin is that they don’t always feel responsive which is completely unacceptable. When you combine the horrible controls with some levels that are already very difficult then you get the feeling that you will never complete the game which puts you off almost immediately. I did however like the variety of levels you can play and some of them are cleverly designed, but ultimately the difficulty curve makes you forget about the clever design in the levels. What amazed me the most with this game is the technical issues it suffers with. A game like this shouldn’t be suffering with framerate problems, but it suffers with these problems throughout and sometimes it becomes that bad that at times it can be unplayable. The content in the game gets repetetive quickly and the lack of variety harms any chance of the game having any replay value. They did manage to get one thing right in the game though and that’s the weight and feel of the ball, but ultimately there’s little else they get right. The presentation side of the game is bland and doesn’t fit the gameplay at all. The soundtrack is also not very good and gets repetetive and annoying very quickly. At the end of the day this is one of them games that has a neat and interesting idea but unfortunately this interesting idea gets lost in the poor execution of the game. The amount of problems the game had shocked me and it never recovers, so any fun you have doesn’t last very long at all.

Maria The Witch,Xbox One,Naps Team,"['Action Adventure', 'Linear']",E,2017-10-31,"Maria the Witch has a clever idea going for it, and at times it can be very fun to play. There is however a few problems that can harm the game’s enjoyability and one of the problems is just unacceptable in a game like this. The problem I’m talking about is the controls. Unfortunately the controls can feel awkward at times and the biggest sin is that they don’t always feel responsive, which is extremely frustrating. What Maria the Witch does well though is that it makes itself accessible to all gamers and there is a decent amount of content for you to sink your teeth into. There are quite a few levels for you to play and they’ve done a good job of making each level have some variety. They also do a good job of teaching the mechanics to you and these added tutorials are something that I was very appreciative of. If you don’t like a challenge then it’s probably best to avoid this game, but I actually quite liked the challenge because in order to get the perfect level you have to do a number of things which in turn gives the game some replay value. I did however get frustrated with having to restart a level because when you die it seems like forever before you start the level again, so you just end up becoming more and more annoyed. The presentation side of the game is very simple, but at the same time it’s effective. The cartoony aesthetic in the game makes the game stand out, and the sound design whilst not amazing is pleasant and doesn’t annoy, which is great. At the end of the day Maria the Witch is one of them game’s that’s perfect for passing a bit of time every now and then. It’s also a game that can be enjoyed by gamers of all ages, but without a doubt I can see the frustration the game gives you at times to be a major put off for some people.

Marooners takes on the party game formula really well and whilst it’s not the best game the genre has to offer there is still without a doubt a lot of enjoyment present in the game. The gameplay is fast, fluid and very simple to pick up and play. People of all ages can play and when there is a group of you then the amount of fun you can have is off the charts. There are a few different modes for you to try out, but without a doubt my favourite mode was Chaos Mode. The name of this mode kind of says it all but I must admit that Chaos Mode definitely has a unique feeling to it. If you haven’t got anybody at hand to play with you then you can play the game on your own, but I will say that the game will be nowhere near as enjoyable when played this way. Another thing I will say is that this game isn’t a game best enjoyed in long periods instead it shines brightest when played in short bursts because things can become repetetive quite quickly. I will say though that the game does have quite a bit replayability and that’s mainly down to the unlockables you can obtain. There are multiple unlockables and each one is worth collecting because you can customise your characters a lot, which is great. I would however have liked a bit more customisation and variety when it came to the weapons you can use in the game. The presentation side of the game is actually something I enjoyed. Visually the game is packed full of colour and looks vibrant at all times and when you combine this with the funny sound design it ends up making your experience even more fun. At the end of the day Marooners has joined a packed genre and it’s certainly not the best party game I’ve ever played, but it’s also far from being the worst. There are some unique touches here and there and this in my opinion is a very good reason to pick up this game. Another reason to pick up the game is because the mechanics are solid and anybody can play and the best thing is that it’s enjoyable for both adults and children, and for that reason it does more than enough to get a thumbs up from me.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition,Xbox One,Tribute Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Horizontal']",,2018-02-06,"I’ve been waiting for Mercenary Kings to come to the Xbox One for quite a while now because the style of the game is definitely right up my alley. Thankfully it was worth the wait because they have managed to get a lot of the important aspects spot on. The gameplay is super addictive and the fast and frantic action really does a great job of creating a fun and adrenaline-fuelled experience. I would however have liked the guns to pack more of a punch and a few more combat moves would have been a nice addition, but other than that they get everything else spot on when it comes to the gameplay. Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition is one of them rare games where it’s both fun playing on your own and in co-op, and there isn’t much in it but the co-op action just edges it for me. In terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you satisfied and each level is an absolute blast to play, so don’t expect to get bored anytime soon. I will say though that the enemies you face could have been a little more exciting and had more in terms of variety, but that doesn’t really become a problem until you get later on in the game. Something that really surprised me about the game was the amount of customisation you can do. I was really impressed that I could give my game a personal touch and by being able to do this things stay fresh for longer. The presentation side of the game ticks a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a real retro feel and look to it and the added modern touches work ever so well. The sound design is pretty good as well and they’ve done a good job of creating an action filled atmosphere. At the end of the day if like me you’ve been waiting for Mercenary Kings to come to the Xbox One then you will be very happy because it was worth the wait. This game is filled with action from to start to finish and the best thing is that the action has been done pretty much to perfection. The problems it has are very small and no more problems reveal themselves throughout, which is great and this allows you to focus solely on the addictive gameplay. Without a doubt Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition gets a big recommendation from me and I can see it being a game I revisit quite often.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Minecraft: Story Mode Season Two - Episode 3: Jailhouse Block,Xbox One,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",E10+,2017-09-19,"Minecraft Story Mode: Season 2 Episode 3 delivers yet another thrilling and engaging storyline along with some action packed themes and impactful story changing decisions different to what we got in Episode 2 along with some dark themed dynamics tailored towards the story. I was exceptionally impressed with Episode 2 with its fast paced action and gameplay and not to mention the plot twist at the end, leaving me in one of the biggest cliff-hangers in this entire franchise. Fortunately Episode 3 does an amazing job at continuing from all of the drama and continuing right where the end of the previous episode left Jesse and his friends and I am not disappointed by it. The writing done to this plot really works and really pays off. Our friend Jesse is sent to a deep, hidden underground prison/reformatory (hence the title of this episode; 'Jailhouse Block') after angering the mentally deranged admin for apparently not showing him as his 'champion' in the previous episode. We are once again reunited with most of the characters featured in the last episode (including the admin during the middle of the episode). The great thing about this is that the first character we are reunited with is determined out of the two characters (Jack or Petra) that was selected during the end of the last episode while deciding on who would go for the clock being the main goal of the episodes plot. This means that depending on who you selected, the beginning of this new episode will be slightly different, though no matter who it is, you will be introduced with an awesome, action packed intro featuring some point and click gameplay just like in Episode 3 of the first season. As well as that, we also get to see a couple of new characters in this episode such as the quirky Warden. We are even reintroduced with a couple of other characters previously seen such as Jesse's friend and assistant Radar, and Nurm the Villager. In the last episode, I had noticed a favourable bond between Jesse and Radar who I had also grown a bond too. During the beginning of this episode however, he is the victim of the episode first major decision which the Warden uses him to influence you into working for him or resisting. During my two play throughs of this episode in choosing both options, I noticed that some of these have very little change to the story while the others have a more impactful change to the storyline. One of these choices made near the end of the episode ends up being not only once of the hardest decisions to make in this entire series, but once of the most heartbreaking. Of course since this episode is set in a dreadful prison, the plot follows Jesse and his friends trying to escape, where they discover that there is one particular prisoner who is the only one who knows the escape route. Referred to as 'Prisoner X', Jesse and his friends must find a way to get to her heavily fortified and guarded cell deep in the prison. based off the choice you made from deciding to work for the Warden or refuse, you will depend on your experience to how you will get yourself to the bottom floor known as the 'Zombie Mines' consisting of all the poor and disgusting prisoners forced to kill and eat zombies. If you decide to work for the Warden, you will promote yourself to working in the room, while if you refuse to, you will find a way to deliberately get yourself into trouble. Once Jesse encounters Prisoner X, Jesse is forced to leave behind one of the series companions; Nurm the Villager and Jacks best frined, or Lluna the Llama the series new animal companion. This choice was both hard and sad to decide because although we hadn't seen these characters that much, what we had seen were strong. Speaking of Stella, we get to see her again where this time she works as an associate and of course has the same bitter & ruthless attitude towards Jesse along with her 'rival' vibe. Some point in the episode, we have the option to let her join us from reasoning with her. if you choose this, than she promises to 'have your back' hopefully in a future episode. And yet again in this episode we are introduced to another cliff hanger though this time it starts during the beginning of the second half of the episode where the admin makes an appearance at the prison bringing back your friend that you chose to retrieve the clock in the previous episode where he tries to force the two of you to fight. After a failed attempt at striking the admin himself, he takes his evil tactics beyond all measures by manipulating Jesse's identity and threatening Beacontown and his older friends. And yet this was all happening when Jesse still has a prison to escape, and once he had, the ending lead to a second cliff hanger!In conclusion, this episode has proven that this season just gets better and better and is the best in the series thanks to all the action, impactful and versatile decisions and consistent cliffhangers which has once again left me very excited for what is to come next.",70,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,5.4,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,0.0,2.0,54.0
Minecraft: Story Mode Season Two - Episode 4: Below the Bedrock,Xbox One,Telltale Games,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",E10+,2017-11-07,"Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 Episode 4 continues this series at a fairly strong pace along with a lot of new factors that both impressed me and disappointed me. Firstly lets start with the setting. As the title suggests 'Below the Bedrock', Jesse and his friends, have just escaped the Sunshine Institute where there only escape route is to venture even deeper underground beneath the bedrock to which we all thought was a vast world or darkness and emptiness. This episode has made us believe that the world of Minecraft Story Mode features an entirely different and forgotten world underneath the Bedrock where the Admin (Romeo) is the one responsible for concealing it and forcing everyone to believe that its empty. This setting like the Sunshine Institute does not stay subtle with the dark themes and yet adds some spookiness right at the start. Yet again we are introduced to a unique nightmarish mob; a giant Enderman. This mob made me feel as if it is there to not only try and kill us but also to annoy us as seen when we encounter it the second time. In the previous episode we met a character initially referred to as 'Prisoner X' and named Xara, where she is revealed to be a former Admin being the reason to why she seemed to know a lot about Romeo the real Admin and the escape route of the prison. While at first a very eerie character who was very reluctant on meeting Jesse, it seems that now all of a sudden she now thoroughly trusts us. Maybe this is just because of her previous personality before being imprisoned and having her friend and former admin Fred killed and still remains distraught but I cannot help thinking of this two-faced personality that Telltale abruptly created. The episode clearly shows her 'aggresive' emotions towards the loss of Fred but does it feel like we're friends all of a sudden? However during my two playthroughs of this episode where I made the opposite choices in the previous episodes as well as this one, I noticed that depending on one of the choices you make in regards to Xara she will either help you fight the mobs who try to impede your escape along with the giant enderman or she will ditch you like Jesse did before. To think that that final choice was completely useless, I guess not. Other new things that was featured in this episode included a trivia test. This is something I have always wanted since my first Telltale game (the Wolf Among Us) because despite being completely irrelevant to the storyline of most games, is something I always fabricated based off the 4 choice point and click style dialogue choices referencing the choice answers or a multiple-choice question. I was happy to see it in this episode but disappointed by the fairly lazy and indifferent way it was implemented into the game. This was a test based of supposed facts about Fred, the fallen leader of the community we were tasked to venture to and the former third Admin. In my first playthrough I did like how you need to free roam the town to learn and study some 'Fred facts' and thought that you need to do this to win the test and progress through the game where other free roam events in previous episodes you can just bypass. During my second playthrough I found out that I was wrong. Whether you pass the test or not, you still progress through the story in finding the weapon to defeating Romeo making the free roaming once again useless to the story. Or you could just wing the test as you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting the question right due to the dialogue choices given to you. How does Jesse even know these without even been given the options. Thankfully the trivia also featured a building contest through the newly introduced building mechanic which was a nice way to implement it into the episode and a lot better than that of the previous episode, but even with that whether you build from absolutely nothing to the coolest thing in the world, the round will end in a draw. So if you spend 2 hours on the episode just on the build, than that's just a waste of time. This episode actually managed to add a second build later on in the episode when you reach the town 'Romeosburg' which again is useless and not worth noting. What is worth noting however is the boss battle we get to do. In the last episode we were able to fight a unique creation of a ghast 'a three headed ghast', this time it was a giant magma golem. Not only was this an awesome design but a really cool and detailed way of defeating it involving water, mining and explosions (just see for yourself, you won't be disappointed). And yet again we are encountered with another battle with the giant enderman just before escaping via a portal and another difficult choice mainly involving which character(s) you will be with in the next episode. Overall, while not the most impressive entry in the series it still managed to keep me intrigued to the story and excited for what is to be a big and thrilling ending to this series.

Mutant Football League,Xbox One,Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC,"['Sports', 'Team', 'Football', 'Arcade']",M,2018-01-19,"I’m a massive fan of the preview program and I find it very rewarding to see a game grow over time. Mutant Football League has come on leaps and bounds over the last few months and the amount of tweaks and changes that have been implemented have satisfied me a great deal, which in turn shows that the developers have been listening to us gamers. The biggest tweaks and changes have definitely come in the controls and mechanics departments. The controls hold up extremely well and over time they’ve become more fluid and responsive, which of course makes the game even more fun. When I first started playing the game I must admit that it did feel a little unfair but since then they’ve rectified this almost perfectly and each mechanic now feels fair and most important of all realistic. Not all areas have seen improvements though and the game still suffers with a few technical issues, but I have full faith that the developers will sort these problems out. In terms of content the game has plenty for you to sink your teeth into and most important of all most of the modes are an absolute blast to play. You will however need to get used to the controls and this does take time because they can be quite confusing and there isn’t much in the way of an explanation unfortunately. Thankfully though this is only a small problem and you will definitely forget about this when your immersed in the fantastic old-school and nostalgic gameplay. The presentation side of the game is absolutely awesome. Visually the game has a very retro feel to it but it also has modern touches here and there which is nice. The sound design is packed full of humour and some of the humour is actually pretty funny and it definitely got a chuckle out of me at times. At the end of the day Mutant Football League is perfect for those who want to take a trip down memory lane, it also has the added bonus of being perfect for newcomers to the genre as well. I have seen this game grow over time and I’m very pleased with the way the game is heading and in my opinion I can see it getting better and better. It does still have a few niggling problems but these aren’t too troubling and they don’t stop me from giving the game a big thumbs up.",0,No score yet,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

NASCAR Heat 2,Xbox One,"Monster Games Inc., 704Games","['Racing', 'Simulation', 'Automobile']",E,2017-09-12,"The sequel to last year’s Heat Evolution, NASCAR Heat 2 brings about some terrific changes to the formula established in the previous title. The Career Mode has been completely overhauled, and it feels great to work through full seasons in the Trucks, Xfinity, or Cup cars. The progression system is basic, but the mode does its best to emerge you in the world of motor-sports. Twitter feeds and pre-recorded video messages featuring many of the the drivers of the sport are fun, but could be improved with the next title. Online Multiplayer is also revamped, and the servers are quite stable. The Online racing is also greatly improved, and the ability to race in a full 40 car field of other live drivers is amazing. Where the games stalls is in performance. On console, the game can barely run at a solid 30 FPS, which is not great considering many new games are locked at 60. The physics are revamped from Evolution, but the graphics are not changed much here, and the lighting on the cars during specific time settings feels incredibly artificial. The cars look great, though, and the details on each of the hundreds of paint schemes are fantastic, and add to the immersion in Career.

But once I passed the controllers over to my 10 year-old and 7 year-old daughters, the real fun began! First off, my girls loved Nuna, the main character of the game.

My 10 year-old then took on the role as the fox. For the next hour, as a family, we had an absolute blast playing, but also watching the videos about the Inupiat people that are embedded into the game.  We especially liked the one about the Arctic Fox. It was very rewarding to watch the two of them work together to solve the puzzles that the game presented.  Soon enough, we were mimicking the noise Nuna makes when the fox ""dies"", and of course we needed to sing ""What Does the Fox Say?"". I will say though, that the polar bear and the ""fireman"" were a bit scary to them.  We would try to lessen the scariness of the ""fireman"" by mimicking what he does when he ""catches up"" with Nuna (he reaches down, grabs her bola and thrusts it powerfully into the air). Probably my daughters favorite part of the game was watching Nuna and the Fox swim, or (SPOILER ALERT) watching the boy fox fly. If there are parents out there searching for a game to buy their young daughters, they should look no further than Never Alone.

Don’t get me wrong this game is fun when played with friends, but your friends aren’t always avaliable so it’s a game that won’t get played very often. It does have single player modes but playing it this way is nowhere near as fun and it just ends up frustrating you because the difficulty can be too much at times. The hit detection also doesn’t help with the difficulty and it just ends up frustrating you even more which is definitely not a good thing in a game like this. The controls though thankfully don’t add to the frustration because they definitely feel tight and responsive throughout. The replay value in the game is very low and that’s mainly down to the modes included in the game. Each mode plays and feels exactly the same and the lack of variation makes the gameplay become tedious very quickly. An inclusion of an online mode would have helped to have give the game more life, but unfortunately there isn’t any online included. The presentation side of the game is very basic, and unfortunately nothing really stands out which definitely follows the trend of the whole game. At the end of the day Ninja Shodown offers glimpses of fun and excitement every now and then, but unfortunately these moments don’t happen enough. I did enjoy the game when I played with some friends but the enjoyment didn’t last very long and we were playing a different game very quickly. As far as a party games go Ninja Shodown won’t be remembered for very long and there are far better games in the genre, so unfortunately I can’t recommend this game to you.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Oh My Godheads,Xbox One,Square Enix,"['Action', 'Fighting', '3D']",T,2017-12-05,"There’s nothing better than playing a fun and decent local multiplayer with friends and without a doubt there are quite a few classic game’s out there for you to sink your teeth into. Unfortunately though Oh My Godheads can’t be called a classic even though it offers you some enjoyable moments from time to time. The main reason this game can’t be called a classic is because it lacks depth and this means things can become boring quite quickly. Don’t get me wrong the game can be an incredible amount of fun for a short period, but to get the best out of the game you do have to play with friends. It does have single player but when you play on your own it gets boring almost instantly and the AI is very lacklustre and not very smart at all, which does makes things become frustrating. The gameplay on the whole has been done very well, and the best thing is that it remains responsive and fluid throughout. They have also thrown in a few unique ideas when it comes to the Godheads you can use, and I must admit that I appreciated the amount of variety the different characters had. In terms of modes the game doesn’t offer much so the replay value in the game is quite low. Some of the modes are also not good enough and I especially found this to be the case when I was tackling the boring trials mode. The presentation side of the game was something I was very fond of. Visually I loved the wacky art style and the sound design in a way makes you enjoy the game a little more, which is great. At the end of the day Oh My Godheads could have given you a lot more and if it did then the game would have got a much higher score from me. Fans of local multiplayers will find some enjoyment here and it does get some of the basics right, but unfortunately any fun is short-lived because there just isn’t enough depth to the game. I can’t unfortunately fully recommend Oh My Godheads to you because there are better game’s in the genre for a cheaper price, so I would wait until the price drops before you give this game a go.",62,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

You have to kill large zombies to get keys to unlock special doors. The game's price is affordable, so it's worth the price of admission. You also get a survival mode that you have to kill so many zombies to move on tho the next wave of zombies... It has a steep difficulty curve, but also fun. I like how there are different maps you can play on like asylum, grave yard, etc. One map is shaped like a space ship plus different zombie types (crawlers and zombies that spit acid at you).

Outlast 2,Xbox One,Red Barrels,"['Action Adventure', 'Survival']",M,2017-04-25,"Outlast 2 is a game that’s meant to be played in the dark. Seriously, the game is not for squeamish or for those that are easily frightened. Everything in this game will make you look once and think twice. If it isn’t the soulless cult-like crazies that get you, the demonic entities and macabre images will. The thing that was so pleasing about Outlast 2 was no matter how much you tried to prepare, the game will always switch it up and scare the crap out of you, which leads me to the best advice I can give any fellow gamer when playing this game, ""don’t look back, just run..."" You don’t get much time to think about what you've just experienced until the game's over and once you reach the end, well… you’ll see. This game is very much about surviving and it takes away the biggest safety blanket that most gamers hold near and dear to them, weapons. It’s human instinct to defend yourself but, what happens when you can’t fight back? Every element of the game is meant to invoke fear and anxiety, taking upon your biggest uncertainties and forcing you to think on your toes. For those that played the first Outlast will quickly notice that the sequel has improved on every front ranging from improved aural sound, to the visuals and even the character face mapping. The game also abandons the confines of being trapped in a claustrophobic insane asylum and now focuses on being lost in the vastness of the desert, where you truly are alone, or are you? Players will step into the shoes of protagonist Blake who is helping his wife Lynn investigate strange happenings in Arizona’s Supai region. While traveling with Lynn, your helicopter suddenly loses power and crashes. Once you come to, Blake quickly discovers that his wife and pilot have gone missing. Surrounded by old dusty shacks, barns, defiled Christian markings, it immediately sets the tone for what you’re in for. One can’t help but notice instantly that the game’s surroundings and enemies remind you of the villagers or cultists in Resident Evil 4. I had a few issues trying to get the hang of the buttons and controls, given that there wasn’t much for a tutorial and there’s no button schematics built into the game. At times, I found myself on my phone having to revert to google before I got it down right. An interesting new element added to the game is allowing you to hit the view/select button and look down at your jacket pockets, allowing you to see how many batteries, bandages and access any recorded footage you have, on the fly. I’ll say this much, after playing Outlast 2, you’ll never underestimate the power of a camcorder again. This is easily the most important tool (weapon?) at your disposal. Nevertheless, how you use it and the night vision can determine the outcome of a few things; simply being able to see where the hell you’re going and two, trying find a place to hide while being chased. There’s nothing more satisfying, frightening and fun about balancing the comfort of being able to see vs conserving battery life, forcing you to rely on lamp posts, fires and the moon’s light to guide your path. The graphics in Outlast 2 are pretty solid. The video camera does most of the work adding a grainy and unfiltered look. You can tell right away that the developers spent some quality time on visuals and at certain points in the game, you'll become so mesmerized that you're actually playing a video game and not watching a movie. It's pleasantly unnerving to experience. One thing that I’ve always seemed to enjoy and appreciate in survival-horror is collecting clues and solving puzzles. From something as simple as locating a key to unlock a door or coming across biblical passage written somewhere in the game will force you to question everything, but don’t stick around too long. The game has a beautiful blend of tranquility and insanity, so it’s best to remember that you collect what you need and get moving or else you’ll have a crazed psycho on your tail. Outlast 2 is a sequel that I’ve been waiting on for a long time. When the first Outlast was released on PC, I didn't own a powerful enough rig to play the game. I can remember saying to myself, ""they would be fools not to release this on Xbox or PlayStation."" It seemed almost immediately after, prayers were answered and Red Barrels announced that they were releasing the game on consoles in 2013.As fun as it was to play this game, it didn’t come without a few annoying elements here and there. Darkness in the game acts as its own entity and often times will frustrate the hell out of you, but the urge to dredge on will captivate you. The storyline is very creative and will keep you interested to the very end. To truly immerse yourself in the game, play it late at night in complete darkness. If you have surround sound, turn it up, I dare you.",77,Generally favorable reviews,10.0,3.0,0.0,6.4,Mixed or average reviews,23.0,11.0,14.0,64.0

Paladin,Xbox One,Pumpkin Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Horizontal']",E,2017-12-08,"As far as twin-stick shooters go Paladin is far from being a classic, but it does have some enjoyable moments for you to get to grips with. The main problem I see with this game is that it doesn’t offer enough and I can see it getting lost in the abyss of the many twin-stick shooters that offer you more. It’s not all doom and gloom though because the gameplay on the whole has been done really well. The controls are fluid and responsive throughout and most important of all it’s fun, but I do think the lack of challenge will put some people off. They balance this though by offering a number of difficulty settings, but I still don’t think this will be enough to satisfy the veterans. Something that really impressed me about the game was the upgrades that are on offer. You can upgrade both your ship and the cities you have to protect and the best thing is that each upgrade feels important and you can tell that it improves you, which is great. When it comes to the content in the game there simply is not enough to keep you invested and I think they could have combated that by including a multiplayer option, but unfortunately they don’t have one. The lack of content definitely hurts the game’s replay value and you will find that once you complete the game then you won’t feel the need to return to the game. The presentation side of the game surprised me and I must admit that I didn’t expect it to be that good. Visually the game looks great and is packed full of colour and the accompanying sound design is the perfect partner for the visuals and in a way this helps enhance the gameplay. At the end of the day Paladin could have been so much better and I would have given it a much higher score if it would have had more content. It’s a shame really because the content it does have is both fun and enjoyable, but there just isn’t enough of it and this means that the replay value is pretty much non-existent. The price at the moment is a little too expensive in my opinion and I wouldn’t recommend it until it reduces in price because there are quite a few twin-stick shooters that are better than Paladin out there.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The first thing I noticed were the Minecraftian graphics. I have to admit, at first I was really apprehensive that I was going to like them, but they grew on me quickly. The game spends no time dicking around and throws you right in the action which is exactly what I wanted. It was very easy to get accustomed to the controls and how everything worked even though that was basically no guidance at all. The map and the general layout of the HUD was done well also. I liked finding the shops on each floor, it kind of reminded me out the shops in the original Zelda games. The bosses are really random and often bizarre The Bad The music got really obnoxious after a short time. Thankfully the settings menu is very simple. The dungeons are randomized, but they don't really change that much. The Achievements I played Paranutical Activity for 9 hours and 16 minutes and managed to unlock 6 out of 45 of the achievements for a total of 120/1000 Gamerscore. Final Verdict Overall I had a good time playing Paranutical Activity and I think it's reasonably priced at $9.99",48,Generally unfavorable reviews,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.8,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,4.0,4.0,38.0

Pillars of Eternity: Complete Edition,Xbox One,"Obsidian Entertainment, Paradox Arctic","['Role-Playing', 'Western-Style']",M,2017-08-29,"Really excited to have this finally come to XBOX One after years of speculation. Not as polished graphically as Divinity Original Sin but a lot more fun and addictive. Love the old school D&D; games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale and this honors them well. Had to get use to the pause and give commands to my party feature versus the turn based combat of D.O.S. but the atmosphere and story is far more gripping than the one in D.O.S. Spell management is a little tricky and rest is not possible to heal or to study your spell book without the campfire equipment found at shops and other merchants. Character creation is fairly diverse. Its great you can have a party of six adventurers instead of just the two you have in D.O.S and when a party member is not being used you can always find them back at the Black Hound Inn. I  have about 15 hours in so far and can't wait to get back to playing it. It can be challenging and you have to go back and keep trying different tactics to defeat different enemies but its not enough to make you rage quit like say Dark Souls caused many, not myself, to do. Party management and character action commands have been made very easy with the XBOX One controls. I will be finishing this and then going back to finish D.O.S",86,Generally favorable reviews,11.0,0.0,0.0,7.6,Generally favorable reviews,15.0,2.0,4.0,76.0

Pinball FX3,Xbox One,Zen Studios,"['Action', 'Pinball']",E10+,2017-09-26,"I have put a great deal of time into playing pinball games over the years, and to say I’m a big fan would be an understatement. So as you can imagine I was really looking forward to Pinball FX3, and thankfully it delivers in pretty much all areas. The gameplay is as good as ever and at times I noticed that it had even seen an improvement in its performance. The ball physics can be a bit off at times, but it doesn’t happen very often and there is no lag whatsoever, which is great. There are a number of tables for you to play, and they have got a perfect balance of classic and new tables. There are a few noticeable tables missing, but there is more than enough here to keep you happy. The replay value in the game is almost endless, and the replay value is even higher this year thanks to some new modes being added. The new modes breathe some fresh air into the series, and the modes have all been done very well. I was especially impressed with the Zen tournaments and you can compete against players online. They also allow you to create your own tournaments, and you can chop and change everything, which is awesome. The presentation side of the game has seen a vast improvement and that especially can be seen in the visuals. Visually everything looks more advanced and newer, and the best thing is that every table has had the same amount of effort put into it. At the end of the day fans of pinball games absolutely must download this immediately. Everything feels as though it has been improved and the amount of effort that’s gone into the game is very noticeable, and as far as pinball games go Pinball FX3 is probably the best pinball game I’ve ever played.",85,Generally favorable reviews,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Pinstripe,Xbox One,Armor Games,"['Miscellaneous', 'General']",T,2018-02-07,"Pinstripe is one of those rare games that makes you think about it long after completion. It stirs up a number of emotions throughout your playthrough and that’s mainly down to its fantastic story. The story grips you straight away and never lets go and in the end you genuinely care about the characters because they’ve been designed and implemented brilliantly. Another thing that stands out is the world in which the game takes place. Everything in the world feels alive and there are plenty of secrets to find which gives the game a little bit of replayability. In terms of the gameplay that’s present in the game you will find some of it pretty enjoyable. The platforming elements of the game play very well and most importantly the controls feel fluid and responsive throughout. There is also a decent amount of puzzles to sink your teeth into as well. Most of the puzzles in the game have been designed really well and I was very impressed with the amount of variety the puzzles had. Pinstripe also has a little bit of combat included in its gameplay, but I found this aspect to be a little lacklustre. The main reason why I wasn’t much for the combat is because everything about it felt awkward and it ended up being frustrating more than anything. In terms of content the game is short, but in my opinion I found the length of the game to be perfect. It doesn’t overstay its welcome and if you want more then you will get more playthroughs if you want to find all of the secrets. If you want to do this though then you’ll have to prepare for a lot of backtracking and if you’re like me then you will find this a tad tedious at times. The presentation side of the game is absolutely stunning in my opinion. Visually the game looks great and looks alive at all times and the accompanying sound design is fantastic, and I must admit that I was especially impressed with the voice actors who I thought did a wonderful job of bringing an emotional side to the game. At the end of the day Pinstripe will no doubt surprise a lot of people and it surprised me as well because I didn’t think it would be this good. They have managed to combine a fantastic story with wonderful characters and also throw in some clever puzzles as well and this without a doubt creates a memorable experience. If you’re a fan of puzzle platformers then Pinstripe is a must buy and if you’re newcomers to the genre then I highly recommend you try this game first.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,"Coco Cucumber, Cococucumber","['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E10+,2017-09-12,"Platforming games have been around for years, with the most easily recognizable series stemming from Nintendo. However, Playdead revolutionized the puzzle-platformer genre in 2010 with Limbo, and every game that has come out in that play style since has been compared – even their follow up title, Inside. When a genre has been defined by a single game, it’s difficult to compete. Another game must either do something fresh, or clone it in a way that keeps you coming back (see: Gunpoint and its clone Ronin). But if you’re a fan of the type of game, does it really need to be better to be enjoyable? Planet of the Eyes puts you in the role of a little robot that has crash landed and is out to discover the other survivor whose story and yours unfold through a series of audio logs. These are on little cassette tapes you’ll pick up throughout the game, and while it’s not at all necessary you collect them (I believe only one was out of the way), they add to the purpose and direction of the game. You’ll be traversing through explosions of color on this alien planet, and if you’re wondering about the title, rest assured you’ll see plenty of eyes (see below for example). The animations are fairly basic, and the climbing one I’d venture to say is stiff at best. Not a game breaker by any means, but when I jump up and cling onto something, I expect some sort of sway in movement, opposed to a static frame of the character holding on. This is the only thing that really stuck out as wrong visually, although nothing was truly awe-inspiring. As for the gameplay itself, you’ll find you can run, jump, or push/pull in the occasional puzzles you’ll come across. And while you’re pressing all the buttons, you’ll likely learn you can dance too, which holds no real purpose other than an achievement from what I could tell. Perhaps there’s a secret that it opens up if done in the right spots, much like in Playdead’s games after finding all the collectibles. While I died a fair amount of times in the game (several, if not most of the achievements are tied to specific deaths), it’s usually not due to the game being difficult. While a couple of puzzles require specific timing for an action or death occurs, it’s more likely you’ll misjudge a jump or not quite make the proper landing as you descend a cliff that ends in your demise. The deaths are fairly amusing, and loading back up only takes a second, so you’ll find yourself ready to destroy your little robot again in no time. The puzzles provided in the game are far from time-consuming. I believe the longest I spent with one was a couple minutes before I realized what I was doing wasn’t working, and went up to where I had been previously to see if I had missed something. Sure enough, it was right in front of me and I had looked at it without knowing I’d need it. The end of the game tests your skill with platforming, which is by no means a challenge, although there is one box puzzle that was easily the most satisfying puzzle in the game as it made me think. I spent between 60-90 minutes with this title, completing it with little to no issue. This is a game that doesn’t put a lot of focus on the skill, but the enjoyment of the journey itself. The sci-fi story that goes along is a nice, albeit unnecessary addition to the game, as these types of things can propel themselves without exposition. But I will say that it was well voiced. If you enjoy platformers with minor puzzle solving, Planet of the Eyes may be a worthwhile experience for you. It’s short (which I appreciate since I don’t have much time for games nowadays), never becomes frustrating, and is family friendly. However, it never really goes beyond the level of mediocre in terms of what it accomplishes, and in some cases feels a bit unpolished. Regardless of the genre pulling me in, there are stronger entries you can be playing.",64,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

A good example of this is Dark Souls... either you love it or you quit before the first boss. If you love Dark Souls and also love strategy games, you'll love this game.

Raining Blobs,Xbox One,Black Shell Games,"['Puzzle', 'Matching']",T,2017-12-20,"Puzzle games like Tetris and Puyo Puyo have been pleasing gamers for generations and I must admit that I love a decent puzzle game. Thankfully Raining Blobs possesses some of the characteristics I seek in a puzzle game, and whilst it has a few problems that take away from your overall experience I must admit that it provided more enjoyable moments than bad moments. The gameplay that’s present here has been done really well and the most important thing is that it’s fun. I will say though that if you don’t enjoy a high challenge then Raining Blobs will frustrate you a great deal because the difficulty curve can cause you a few problems at times. In terms of content the game has plenty for you to sink your teeth into and each mode feels considerably different from the other, which is great. Some modes are definitely better than others and I found the game to be most enjoyable when played in local co-op. It does have single player content as well, but I found the story mode to be a little basic which ultimately resulted in the memorable moments being few and far between. When it comes to the replay value in the game then you will actually be quite surprised because there is quite a lot of it present. The main reason for the high replay value is due to the leaderboards which will definitely have you returning multiple times. In order to get the full value of this game though you will have to look past a few niggling problems and the main problem for me was the controls, which were definitely a nuisance at times. The presentation side of the game ticks a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game’s art looks great at times and the accompanying soundtrack is very catchy and the best thing is that it never seems to get on your nerves. At the end of the day Raining Blobs might not do anything different from the other game’s in this particular genre, but in my opinion it doesn’t need to because the tried and tested formula is still enjoyable to this day and this makes Raining Blobs a good addition to the puzzle world. It does however suffer with a few problems that stop it from reaching its full potential, but it gets more things right than wrong and for that reason it does enough to get a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Thankfully Real Farm is actually pretty good even though it suffers with a few problems here and there. The field management system in the game is absolutely fantastic. This system allows you to change everything and it really does give the game a realistic feel. Real Farm also boasts a very good career mode that has a lot of depth going for it, and without a doubt you will sink quite a few hours in here. I was however a little disappointed to learn that there were no multiplayer modes included, and in my opinion a multiplayer mode would have made the game more fun. The gameplay though can be fun at times and the game does a great job of giving you a rewarding feeling, which means the game has quite a bit of replay value. I was also very impressed with the tutorials the game offers you because they explain everything very clearly and you feel that you know what you’re doing straight away, which is great. The game unfortunately has no licensed products, and whilst this isn’t a major problem it can hurt the game’s realism somewhat. The presentation side of the game is brilliant and it’s probably the best looking farming game I’ve ever played. The visuals can look stunning at times and I love how much detail they’ve included in the game. At the end of the day as far farming simulation games go Real Farm is a pretty decent addition to the genre. It’s not perfect and it does suffer with some technical issues from time to time, but the amount of tasks and details in the game is fantastic and at times you actually feel like you’re farming in real life. If you’re a fan of farming simulation games then this is a must buy for you, and in the end it gets a good recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Refunct,Xbox One,Dominique Grieshofer,"['Action', 'Platformer', '3D']",E,2017-06-07,"Refunct is a game about nothing. There is no complex narrative, no tutorial, no menacing villain twirling a handlebar mustache, no damsel in distress, no fear of death; I repeat, this is a game about nothing. I know, that doesn’t sound very appealing at all, but I assure you; this was the most cathartic gaming experience I’ve had in years. I purchased this game while it was on sale for a whopping $1.50 at release and was pleasantly surprised with the effect it had on me. I played it during a break over the course of my recent, super stressful move, and instantly felt a sense of calm come over me as I ran, jumped, and climbed from point to point. You begin Refunct in an open seaside landscape with a few pillars of varying heights with a red hue above one of them. With each pillar you land on, the color will change from a dull grey to a bright, colorful green. You’ll get the hang of the super intuitive controls almost immediately and work your way to the light, which will add additional pillars to jump to. This process will repeat throughout your time with Refunct, with each red light adding a little more to the mechanics and size of the level. Eventually, you will be climbing, ducking, sliding and using physics to your advantage. Think Mirror’s Edge or Portal 2 without the pesky combat or fear of death. As I mentioned before, you cannot die in this game. Not from fall damage, drowning, spider crabs or villainous potatoes that have been inhabited by sentient A.I. programs. The progression in the game is not timed, so you feel absolutely no sense of urgency when completing your goals. The puzzles are so simple, yet complex just enough to keep you engaged. While certainly not for everyone, this game was what I wanted when I needed it, even if I didn’t know it yet. While the visuals are nothing spectacular, they are not a disservice either. The sound is very minimal and promotes the games overall calm atmosphere. The controls are very forgiving and work as they should. While nothing is out of the ordinary, I assure you, Refunct is the anti-rage quit. The only downfall that can be found is the overall lack of content. While it’s an indie title that I highly recommend purchasing, you can finish the game in minutes. My initial playthrough was around a half hour, and there are achievements for completing the game in as little as 4 minutes. This is no easy task, as I have tried this a few times and my best run was a little over 7 minutes. Unfortunately, the subsequent playthroughs do not offer me the same cathartic feeling. This could be due to knowing what I was getting into, or trying to meet the speed run requirement. Outside of the speed run potential, you can also attempt to beat the game without jumping on all of the platforms, taking shortcuts, and using physics based choices. Finally, there are mini cubes that look eerily similar to the companion cube from the Portal franchise. Collecting all of these gives you the option to change the color of the tiles as you work your way through the game. If the grind of shooting the Fallen in the face has gotten you down, or you’re simply needing something to cure that itch for a new Portal entry, Refunct is a game I would recommend for anyone who wants a break from the stress other games can offer. You won’t be disappointed.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.8,Generally favorable reviews,3.0,0.0,1.0,78.0
Rememoried,Xbox One,Hangonit,"['Adventure', '3D', 'First-Person']",T,2017-12-06,"I didn’t know what to expect with Rememoried and when I started to play it I still didn’t quite get it, but in a way I kind of liked the unusual style. Don’t get me wrong the game does have quite a few problems, but in the end I enjoyed it more than I disliked it. Each level in the game is considerably different and you can definitely see that a lot of thought and effort has gone in here. I would however have liked a little help on some of the levels because figuring things out did make me end up getting frustrated from time to time. Thankfully everything else is simplistic and that works in the game’s favour because keeping it simplistic makes you become more immersed in the game. This title features some platforming in its gameplay and this in my opinion is probably the worst thing about the game. It’s probably the worst thing because everything here just feels awkward and unresponsive, which is a shame because it harms the experimental side of the game. Speaking of experimental, when it comes to certain things the game’s experminental side can be brilliant and it really gives the game a unique feeling. Unfortunately though this unique feeling doesn’t last very long because the game can be completed quite quickly and once completed there really isn’t no reason to return. The presentation side of the game is definitely a bit hit and miss. Visually the game looks great and the atmosphere they manage to create is very unique. Unfortunately the same can’t be said about the sound design and in my opinion the sound design just doesn’t connect with the visuals that are on offer throughout the game. At the end of the day unusual game’s are something that I really like because they break away from the usual mould, and Rememoried can definitely be classed as unusual. Don’t get me wrong this game will not be for everybody and it’s not going to win any awards, but I must admit that it ended up drawing me in at certain times, and this is the main reason why it just does enough to get a recommendation from me, but I would wait until it comes down in price before purchasing it.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Road Rage,Xbox One,Maximum Games,"['Simulation', 'Vehicle', 'Combat']",M,2017-11-14,"I spent a great deal of time playing Road Rash back in the day, and without a doubt it was one of the most enjoyable and satisfying games around in that era. When Road Rage was first announced to say I was excited was definitely an understatement. Unfortunately though this adaptation of Road Rash is simply awful and it never offers you anything that will make you fall in love with it like its predecessors did. The amount of technical issues in the game is way too high and this will already be enough to put a lot of people off, but this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Road Rage’s problems. The riding and combat in the game are simply awful and offer you nothing at all. Riding feels unresponsive and never feels exciting and the combat is even more dull with every weapon feeling the same and never packing a punch to even remotely satisfy you. It does have a bit of variety when it comes to the missions you can take part in, but this is quickly forgotten because the world in which the game takes place in is lifeless and the AI has nothing going for it. They have tried to add a story in the game but this is also a failure and nothing that’s included in the story is memorable at all. The presentation side of the game is definitely hit and miss. I actually quite enjoyed the soundtrack that was present in the game, but when it came to the visuals I was really disappointed because certain areas can look really ugly at times. At the end of the day to say that I was really disappointed with Road Rage would be a massive understatement. The game fails to get any of the basics right, and there really isn’t anything that will make you want to keep playing. Some of the problems in the game are completely unforgivable and without a doubt this game tarnishes the good reputation of the Road Rash series. I can’t stress enough that you should stay away from this game and if you were a fan of the Road Rash series then you will find this game horrifying.",33,Generally unfavorable reviews,0.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0

In addition to the arcade controls, the return of 3-Click swings appeals to nostalgic gamers who prefer to set power and accuracy by tapping a button rather than moving a thumbstick. Those looking for an extra challenge can turn on Tour settings. When playing with Tour controls, the length of your backswing and speed of your follow through determine power, while the club path through the ball will be the most important factor in accounting for accuracy. Fans can also mix and match all three settings to create their own custom gameplay style. Courses themselves also affect how your shots are played, as firmer, links-style courses like St. Andrews provides more bounce and roll, while softer courses such as TPC Sawgrass have less bounce and be more receptive to spin.

Samsara,Xbox One,Marker Limited,"['Puzzle', 'Action']",,2018-02-07,"A lot of puzzle games that have made their way to consoles in recent years, and while they do lack action in terms of the gameplay I must admit that I do enjoy a good puzzle game. In order to make a successful puzzle game you obviously have to have decent puzzles and thankfully Samsara brings you some fantastic puzzles. There are over 70 puzzles for you to get to grips with in this game and some of them are really cleverly designed and have lots of variety. You really have to think about some of the puzzles and I liked that the game didn’t hold my hand when attempting to complete them because when you complete a difficult puzzle you get a great sense of satisfaction and reward. I will say though that some people may be put off by the difficulty of the puzzles and I would be lying if I said I didn’t get frustrated from time to time, but I definitely enjoyed it more than I got frustrated. The controls in the game hold up really well and they remain responsive throughout, so I never got frustrated at these which is great. Something that really impressed me about Samsara was the unique feeling of the mechanics that are in play during the game. Each mechanic feels original and this means things rarely get tedious and that means you want to continue time and time again. In terms of content there isn’t a great deal, which is a shame. Without a doubt I would have liked to have been able to have more content to play and that’s a testament to how good the game is because I enjoyed it so much. The presentation side of the game is simplistic in design and for me that works for the game really well. Visually the game is packed full of mesmerising colours and the accompanying sound design is simple yet effective and in my opinion it definitely gives the game a unique feel. At the end of the day as far as puzzle games go Samsara is a wonderful addition to the genre. This game is rare in the fact that it never seems to get repetetive and I must admit that I’ve hardly experienced that in a puzzle game before. Samsara won’t be for everyone and if you like action-packed games then this is something you won’t enjoy, but fans of any sort of puzzle games will absolutely adore this and me being a fan of this type of genre can’t recommend Samsara enough.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo,Xbox One,Milestone S.r.l,"['Racing', 'General']",E,2016-01-29,"I've put about 15 hours into SLRE so far and to be quite honest, it's a really a great rally game. Of course it's not without it's flaws. First and foremost the actual physics engine powering the game is surprisingly robust. It's pretty nuanced as well. You'll definitely need to dedicate some time to getting the feel for it. The graphics are serviceable, but nowhere near DiRT Rally quality. You'll often see a lot of pop-up, textures drawing in and really rough shadows. That said SLRE does have it's own certain charm. The sound effects and music are by far the weakest points of the game. While some vehicles sound throaty and give a satisfying growl, most sound like an angry bee hive and lack any sort of depth. Again what it all boils down to is how it feels and SLRE feels really good when the physics are hitting on all cylinders. Weight transfer plays a huge part in the handling, I'd say maybe even more so than DiRT Rally. Milestone really did excellent with the physics engine in SLRE. I keep talking about the physics because for all it gets wrong, it gets the feel of driving right. The AI in the rallycross events is actually pretty decent and will give you a run for your money. Though they often act overly aggressive and often slam into you as if you're not there at all. The framerate definitely leaves a lot to be desired and often hits in the sub 25 FPS range. Only a few times did it actually get in the way of driving, but not often. I'd say that there's enough room for SLRE and DiRT Rally to exist in your game library. They both have their strengths and weaknesses and complement each other quite well. If you have a chance to try out SLRE, give it a shot, it's worth your time.",63,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,7.0,1.0,7.8,Generally favorable reviews,18.0,2.0,5.0,78.0

SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell,Xbox One,Pine Studio,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Arcade']",M,2017-09-22,"As a hardcore metal head, I found the opening of SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell to be the most metal opening in gaming since the first reveal for the Doom reboot. The game opens with our hero sitting back and relaxing with a six pack when the devil comes along and steals his beer. Now, no self-respecting metal fan will allow this to happen without a fight. Sadly, the devil also took one of your hands, but not before you could steal his in return. So, what do you do if the devil takes your hand AND your beer? You duct tape his hand to your own stump Ash William’s style and go after him. Upon entering a very detailed, vivid depiction of Hell, you are set forth to make it from point A to point B at neck breaking speeds. I found the depiction of Hell to be straight from my nightmares and only comparable to Doom or the upcoming Agony. Not that you have much time to take in the sights, since this is a speedrunning game with a painfully short timeframe allowed to complete each level. As you’d expect, failing to complete the level in the limit results in the option to replay it. I often was able to only achieve a bronze medal, after multiple attempts, within milliseconds of the deadline. While it’s an exhilarating feeling when you complete the section within this timeframe, it is disappointing many players will not be able to see all this game has to offer. I found this time limit to be somewhat unfair, as I was unable to find any obvious shortcuts through the level, nor was I able to achieve a gold rating on a flawless run. The leaderboards presented at the end of each level only confirmed my claim, as I was in the top 10 of the prerelease player base on multiple levels, which steadily declined from around 50 entries, to under 10 by the second chapter. While you can skip ahead to other runs, you must receive a set number of medals prior to facing the “boss” battle. I use this term loosely, as you don’t truly fight a boss; you are faced with a less linear map to run through with more traps that are akin to an actual puzzle opposed to a battle. These were a high-point, as I found the puzzle levels to be much more enjoyable and the time limit to be more forgiving. While not used on any enemies, you are equipped with the devil’s hand, which can summon and throw fireballs at will. In my time with the game, I was only able to use these against mines blocking the path and to trigger switches. As you progress, you will acquire other abilities that add additional depth to the game. Controlling said abilities works as it should; however, there is a bullet time-ish delay when you hold the button to trigger the ability – this was an annoyance and caused some unneeded deaths due to the jarring effect it has to your own momentum. Since momentum is your friend and losing it at the wrong time causes you to over or undershoot your target, I was thankful this option could be turned off. Boasting a whopping 90+ levels and featuring collectible cans of beer throughout the levels, there is a wealth of content here. It’s a shame that I, and I am assuming a number of gamers who take the plunge, will never get to see all of it due to the time constraints.",77,Generally favorable reviews,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
Shadow Complex Remastered,Xbox One,Chair Entertainment,"['Action', 'Shooter', 'Third-Person', 'Arcade']",T,2016-03-16,"Shadow Complex Remastered, released May 3rd for Steam and PS4, and previously released for Xbox One, is true to the original, but is cleaned up with a new shiny coat of paint. While I don't think the 360 original looked bad at all, this version makes the most of the original assets, and releasing on different platforms allows a new generation of people to experience this great game. The Good For those that haven't played the game before, Shadow Complex Remastered is a Metroidvania style game, and starts with a couple out for a hike. The main character, Jason, discovers his girlfriend has been captured, because apparently they had stumbled upon a secret military base, and a plan to take over the American Government. Jason's main goal is to rescue his girlfriend, but the more he explores, he realizes he has to take action. As you traverse the map, finding secrets and hidden passages, you begin to unlock upgrades for your weaponry and abilities, in true Metroidvania fashion. The ultimate goal of the game, besides rescuing your girlfriend and saving the country, is to uncover 100% of the map, and find all hidden collectibles as you proceed through the story. The more health and weapon upgrades you find, the easier it will make your path to victory. The great thing about this game is that the action and set pieces all flow together so well that you feel like a hero. The epic confrontations with giant mechs, helicoptors, and heavily armed soldiers will keep you on your toes. Everything flows together well to blend a great action game, with a sense of adventure, all while letting you explore if you want. The Bad The story of the game is standard fare, and though it is based on an Orson Scott Card novel ""Empire"", it isn't very memorable. I wouldn't call the story 'bad'...but it isn't that great either. While the story fails, that isn't the games main focus, so I can let is slide. Characters could have been more fleshed out, but the way this game plays, with minimal cut scenes, that could change the pacing of the game, which I wouldn't want. Although the combat and set pieces in this game are well planned out, the choice of having this be a 2.5D game causes some issues with the shooting mechanics. Luckily the places where it causes issue don't pop up often, but it can get frustrating dying because the gun didn't shoot where you wanted it to. Checkpoints are provided often, so you never have far to go if you do die, which is nice. The other main issue I came across in this game were certain sections where it seemed the camera didn't follow as it should. When I needed to swim through a cavern, the camera would focus on the sediment at the bottom of the water pool, and I couldn't see myself. Again, this only happened a couple of times, and it didn't change the gameplay, once I figured out where I needed to go and orientated myself. The Achievements The achievements in this game are pretty good. You will get at least 15 achievements for completing the game and finding all of the collectibles. Even more will be unlocked if you kill enemies a certain way, get head-shots, etc. The skill required to complete this game is fairly high, as you will need to complete it in under 2 hours on any difficulty, and under 3 hours on Insane. There are also a few achievements for the minimalist, like completing the game with 4% of the stuff you should pick up. Because of this, it will require several playthroughs. Final Verdict Shadow Complex Remastered is a great game that is highly recommended, and although it shows its age in certain places, it is still one of the best games available today, and owners of any of the platforms available should play it, especially those that are fans of Metroidvania style games. Give it a shot, and you won't be disappointed. And if you played it previously on the 360, play it again for the Challenges and new achievements!",74,Mixed or average reviews,8.0,6.0,0.0,6.1,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,0.0,3.0,61.0

Shift Happens,Xbox One,Deck 13,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2017-02-22,"In a community where bright and shiny new, indie platformers pop up in the online store weekly, you want to hope you have something to make you stand out of the crowd, before people hand over their hard-earned cash. “Shift Happens” developed by Deck 13 and Klonk Games is an arcade style platformer with physic-based puzzles galore, and certainly something you and your friends can get stuck into. ‘Shift Happens’ is definitely not a plot driven game. Essentially, you play simultaneously between two comical, jelly-like characters named Bismo and Plom, who like straight out of a superhero movie, got their abilities in an unfortunate accident. The objective of the game is to shift between each character to solve puzzles, avoid obstacles and platform your way through the many levels in the four distinct stages (The lab, Forest, Grotto and Canyon) and to eventual freedom. The game is broken into two modes, solo and multiplayer. Solo play means you control both of these blobs on your own. You switch between controlling one at time, while also having control over their power to be bigger or smaller, however neither can be the same size at the same time. You are often required to master quite a few skills such as strategically throwing your partner and boxes, changing size mid-air and balancing out pressure platforms. In this game, timing is everything and it can get tedious if your reactions aren’t super quick. Controlling my little blobby pals became finicky, especially if you were required to throw one, then mid-air change to the other character and resize him. Often or not my timing wasn’t quick enough, resulting in a spray of swearing being heard around my room as I had to trudge my character all the way back to the start, to begin again. In the rare moments, you do become stuck on a puzzle (because most are generally quite simple) ,there is little or no indication of what needs to be done, at times leaving me in the fetal position a frustrated, quivering mess mumbling to myself that ‘I am actually smart’. Along the way, you can also collect all 75 coins, beat time trials or find and solve the what I call the elusive ‘Marshmallow’ cube challenge, in each level. Having these collectibles were all well and good but I really had no urge or incentive to replay levels to collect them, and often just ran by them. The only collectible worth tackling was the cube, as it at times really required some thought and was a challenge to acquire.Multiplayer Co-Op is very similar to the story mode gameplay wise, however with different obstacles to conquer. The real value you get from it though is the seer enjoyment you get playing with a friend. It was nice to communicate with someone physically in the same room as me, as we played. It brought back instant memories of my childhood, sitting crossed legged on the carpet with my best friend Lynette playing Mario Cart, laughing, berating and shoving each other, at every in-game decision. This mode has some enticement to collect coins because it was a competition to collect more than your partner. At times, it got down right brutal as you could trigger a size change in your friend at the wrong moment killing them, giving you the opportunity to steal their coins for yourself. Movement with two people playing has such a more natural flow than the solo mode, clearly showing the developers true motives was to invest much of its TLC into its Co-op play. The environments lacked much creative thought and without the obstacles littered in the level, there isn’t much with great detail to look at. The blobs themselves though were quite adorable and memorable...despite being well.. gelatinous blobs. Overall, this is a fairly decent, but often frustrating platformer, when playing by your lonesome. Playing with a group of people is where the true fun is. If you are completely uncoordinated like I am, you will need time to ‘get good’. This game encourages you to take the Co-op route, and to be honest it’s more enjoyable to play a game were communication was key, something lacking in most games. This review is brought to you by MKAUGaming",69,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0

Skyforge,Xbox One,MY COM,"['Role-Playing', 'Massively Multiplayer']",,2017-11-10,"I have sunk a great deal of hours into MMO’s over the years and I’ve had a lot of very enjoyable moments over the years as well. Thankfully Skyforge is a very good addition to the MMO genre and I can see it providing enjoyable moments for some time to come. There is a decent amount of content for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each different mode is very fun and each mode has quite clearly had a lot of effort put into them. I will say though that the side missions can become boring quite quickly and the main reason for that is the lack of variety they have. Thankfully the game doesn’t suffer with a lack of variety in other areas though, and that’s especially the case when it comes to the enemies you face in the game. Each enemy gives you a different challenge and this means things stay fresh and interesting, which is great. The character creation in the game also has a lot of variety, and without a doubt it offers you character creations that are up there with the best game’s in the genre. I will say however that in order to get the best loot you will have to grind for considerable periods and this can become boring after a while. The presentation side of the game has quite a lot of good going for it, especially when it came to the visuals. Visually the game can look fantastic at times and it offers you lots of detail, which is great. The sound design can also be good at times, but I must admit that I was looking for a lot more from the voice acting in the game. At the end of the day I can definitely see Skyforge getting a healthy fan base here on Xbox One, and I can definitely see the game going from strength to strength over time. At the moment it does have a few niggling problems here and there but these can be easily rectified.

It either copies or pay homage to IPs like Ratchet & Clank and Jak & Daxter.The 3D platforming is a joy and I constantly looked forward to see what was in store for me around every corner.Controls are almost perfectly tight.  The only time I had a problem was when battling the little enemy computers.  It felt like the punch happened a millisecond or two after pushing the button, but it wasn't a detriment to the enjoyment of the game.Also a couple of times I got caught in an obscuring camera angle, but it was very rare.The story is just meant to be fun but the voice acting of the main villain is HILARIOUS and is almost by itself a good reason to buy this game.My biggest complaint was that the game was way too short.  Basically 3 medium sized worlds and a final stage.  Difficulty is pleasant.  Only twice did I have to repeat an area a few times in order to beat it.If you like 3D platformers then i highly recommend this title.

Slayaway Camp: Butcher's Cut,Xbox One,"Blue Wizard Digital Ltd., Blue Wizard Digital","['Puzzle', 'Action']",M,2017-10-23,"This is a game that is perfect for fans of cheesy horror movies, and in my opinion they haven’t done a bad job at all. There is a few niggling problems here and there, but overall I ended up enjoying Slayaway Camp: Butcher’s Cut way more than I hated it. The main reason why I enjoyed this game is because of the excellent level design. The level design is very creative and has a huge amount of variety which in turn keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. There is also a huge amount of unlockables for you to get to grips with and these do give the game some replayability which is badly needed because once you complete the game unfortunately there is nothing much that will bring you back. It is however very fun while it lasts and that’s because of the amount of variety the game has, and that’s especially the case when it comes to the characters you can play. There are an abundance of killers to choose from and each one has had a lot of work put into them and I appreciate the effort greatly. The humour the characters bring in the game however failed to hit the spot for me. I did find it funny briefly, but in the end it just got too repetetive and too cheesy for its own good. The presentation side of the game fits the game’s style perfectly. Visually the blocky art has lots of nice little details and they’ve captured the gore really well, and when you combine this with the sound design then it makes the gameplay even more enjoyable. At the end of the day Slayaway Camp: Butcher’s Cut is one of them games that’s perfect for passing a couple of hours every now and then. It does a great job of never outstaying its welcome, and most important of all it can be pretty fun at times. It does have a few problems and this does stop it from getting an higher score but it doesn’t stop it from getting a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Solar Shifter EX,Xbox One,Elder Games,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Vertical']",E,2016-08-26,"Elders Games 2-D vertical space shooter Solar Shifter EX has finally made its way to the consoles thanks to Head Up Games.  This wild and crazy bullet hell is going to test your skills, and your patience.You take control of your ship and try to drive off the last remains of an alien force that is threatening to destroy the sun.  These aliens are bent on your destruction and will send wave after wave to try and end your quest to preserve  life as you know it.Story aside, game play is simple, avoid incoming bullets and try to take out as many enemies as you can.  When you destroy an enemy, they will drop energy that can be used to upgrade your weapons if you are able to make it through the stage.  You can also use the right stick to jump to one of four different areas of the screen to instantly avoid incoming damage - this is a good thing because your screen goes from empty to saturated with bullets quicker than you can curse.  The jump or shift mechanic is something that you will have to get used to using as tapping the stick in the wrong direction will certainly be instant death.This game doesn't just require good reflexes and aim, it demands them.  You will get very frustrated fairly early into the 18 missions if you are not able to dodge incoming attacks.  The missions do feature a fair amount of check points, but even taking that into account, you are going to have to memorize EXACTLY where you need to be if you are not the quickest on the stick.  Even that is an iffy prospect when a few stray bullets will cause you to head right back to the last check point.  There are very few spots where you can actually earn health, so you have to protect what little you do have.  Unless you are playing as one of the alien ships - those things seem to be able to take a beating.The graphics in the game are beautiful.  You will fly over 8 different environments through the course of the game, but you don't just fly bottom to top.  The board will twist a bit in between sections which makes for a nice change over a lot of other shooters.  There is also a wide variety of enemies to blast, and they will light up the screen with missiles, lasers and  other deadly projectiles.  The music is a pumping score that unfortunately gets a bit drowned out with all the cannon fire.   Luckily you can adjust the sound in the options menu.The game boasts 12 achievements on the XB1 version and getting them all will be a testament to your skill as a player.  While 8 of them can be earned by making it through the game the rest will require something special.  You will have to complete 4 different levels without taking any damage, and that will be a true test of gaming prowess.Solar Shifter EX is available on XB1 and Steam. It has been announced as coming to the PS4.  You can grab it and test your skills for $9.99.",53,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0

I agree that the pictures on the store are deceiving, because I and friends thought it would be terrible when it turned out to be an extremely entertaining game. The concept is simple: outrun your opponents to an extent where they are so far behind they fall off the screen. This is very fun with the simple yet powerful 2-dimensional graphics that make you mad at your friends and wanting to play again at the same time. Powerups (that include dragging your opponents back with hooks and shooting them with missiles) provide a humorous experience that keeps you wanting more game time. Carefully chosen fast-paced and rhythmic music adds to the suspense of who will be triumphant. Multiple maps provide variety whilst a roulette wheel and other game-changing options never leave you with a boring experience. It is hard to express what a change of heart I had when I first picked up the controller and started playing this game - sure, the menus could be a bit clearer for the purpose of the game you want to play, and the tutorial doesn't exactly tell you everything you need to know, but once you get into the groove of things, this makes no difference whatsoever. There are some worries regarding camera issues when one player is quite a way ahead, but this can be beneficial as it allows the others to catch up which adds to the later suspense (this issue isn't that major). All this comes with no disc but an extremely low download size from the store and the ability to play offline with the practice and story modes, and online with local or online multiplayer. Updates are also very small, so it's a great addition to your Xbox One for that small amount of space you have left. In conclusion, running, jumping and swinging is so much more fun than you ever thought, especially with friends.

Splasher,Xbox One,Plug In Digital,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2017-09-26,"Splasher is a game that gets everything pretty much spot on. This means that as far as platformers go it’s an excellent addition to the genre, and it’s a game that is both challenging and rewarding at the same time. The platforming and shooting mechanics have been done to perfection. These mechanics are both responsive and fluid, and they create a great deal of fun, which is ultimately what you want from a platformer. I was also impressed with the control scheme in the game because they’ve made you be able to do multiple things at once flawlessly. The level design in the game is some of the best I’ve seen when it comes to the platforming genre. Each level is interesting and fun, and you can tell that a great deal of effort has gone into making each level different. The later levels will cause you some frustration though because they can be quite difficult, but I appreciated the challenge in the end. I was very impressed with the variety when it came to the enemies and obstacles. Each enemy does different things and this keeps the gameplay fresh, which is great. The presentation side of the game is something that impressed me a great deal. Visually the cartoony art style lends the game a certain charm and makes the gameplay stand out. The music that accompanies the gameplay is great on the ears, and most important of all it never gets on your nerves. At the end of the day Splasher has been without a shadow of a doubt one of the most enjoyable games I’ve played so far this year. It’s managed to create the great feeling that a platformer should have and kept the niggling problems down to a minimum.

Super Cloudbuilt,Xbox One,"Coilworks, Double Eleven","['Action Adventure', 'General']",T,2017-07-28,"Disclaimer: I was a QA tester for SCB and am friends with the developers. Also, I loved the original to death and all of this colors my opinion. Super Cloudbuilt is wonderful, it is everything Cloudbuilt wanted to be polished to perfection. I put over 900 hours into the original Cloudbuilt, and while the core mechanics were phenomenal and I obviously love it it did have some obvious flaws. The story was a notable weak point and the whole game lacked a sense of polish, on top of that several of the game modes were prone to crashing and a couple of bugs with the movement simplified the game to much at the highest level. I'm happy to say that all of that has been addressed in Super Cloudbuilt The core of what made Cloudbuilt great is still here, that freedom of choice and the feeling of exploration is made all the more viceral by the redesigned levels and expansive design incorperated into every piece of the game. The movement is more refined, allowing new players to pick up the game more quickly and feel greater control over their motions. Demi feels as if she has actual weight and momentum now and the strange way Demi liked to get stuck on things in the original is gone. The story and level select have been overhauled from the ground up. The hospital hub world is compact yet full of detail and the fact that Demi's monologues can be listened to inside loading screens or as you begin a new level keeps them from breaking the flow as they did in the original. The voice acting is also much improved, as well as the writing. Finally, the polish. Everything about Super Cloudbuilt screams polish. The menus are sleek and modern, the inventory system is simple and effective, and everything is where you would expect it to be. All of this combined with a new global leaderboard system and the many gamemodes Cloudbulit has always had gives hours of content for those people who want to go fast while still providing rewards for those who want to play more casually. For me Super Cloudbuilt is a 10/10, everything about this game is an improvement upon the original and it has earned it's spot as one of my favorite games of all time.",74,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,4.0,0.0,8.8,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,2.0,0.0,88.0

When the characters wear a given costume, they get, more or less, the powers associated with that particular character. So, in costume as Chun-Li from Street Fighter II, Annie gets her famous Flash Kick, whereas dressing up as Mayor Mike Haggar from Final Fight yields his timeless 360 spinning punch. The point of all this is to team up with up to three buddies and go kick some zombie ass. Levels range from straight-up zombie swatting, to vehicle races, to hostage rescues, to boss fights. Missions generally come strung together in a series, with players scored against each other based on achievements, and and also as a team. Power-ups and weapons abound, and players can build their personal power-up bars by killing zombies, unleashing their special moves once the bar is charged up. And many zombies will be killed in Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha.

The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human,Xbox One,Digerati,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",T,2018-01-19,"I love a good Metroidvania and a good Metroidvania is a game that has it’s main mechanics and aspects working together flawlessly and that’s exactly what you get with The Aquatic Adventure of The Last Human. Exploration plays a big part in this specific genre and thankfully this game allows you to explore in great detail and the best thing is that this game is at its most rewarding when doing this. The game has a number of different mechanics in play at the same time and they’ve all been done really well. This makes the game very fulfilling and this will no doubt appeal to a number of different gamer’s. The gameplay on the whole has been done really well and I was especially fond of the boss battles. The boss battles carry with them a distinct challenge and when you combine that with the clever design of them you end up becoming immersed with them quite a lot. I will say though that the challenging aspect of the game won’t be for everybody and I must admit that I myself did find it a tad too difficult at times. Something that really surprised me about this game was how enjoyable the story was. The story in the game is told in a clever way and this keeps things interesting and it also makes you want to discover more things about the story. In terms of length the game doesn’t offer you a great deal and that will disappoint some because if you’re anything like me then you will want a lot more, which in a way is a testament to how good the game is. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed. The visuals are spot on and I think the 8-bit art style fits the game’s theme very well. The same can also be said about the sound design used in the game and they really have done a wonderful job of capturing certain feelings. At the end of the day I’ve heard a lot of good things about The Aquatic Adventure of The Last Human and now I can see why. They’ve done everything pretty much to perfection and delivered on the areas you would expect in this specific genre. It is a little on the short side but your time with the game will be very rewarding and without a doubt this definitely makes the game a must buy.",68,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0

The Banner Saga,Xbox One,Stoic,"['Role-Playing', 'General', 'Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Tactics']",T,2016-01-12,"Banner Saga is proof that there are great ideas on Kickstarter and they will be completed.  Financially backed by hundreds of people making donations,   Banner Saga was developed by Stoic.  Stoic is a 3 person team and the game was published by Versus Evil, another very small company, led by a former Bethesda employee. The game is heavily Viking themed.  There are two parts to the game play.  First is the side scrolling storytelling and decision making part.  Second is a turn based, top down, board game-esque, Dungeons and Dragons style combat. You play from the points of view of a handful of heroes who are trying to get to safety as the world around them comes to an end.  In this game you have to make what seem like very easy decisions up to world changing decisions.  An example of this is choosing to turn away or embrace a group of thieves who want to join your caravan.  The world is ending, you’re horribly outnumbered and need anyone who’s willing to help.  Unfortunately even during the worst of times, terrible people often don’t change who they are.  The thieves may simply want to join you for an easy score. The antagonists in this game are a race of stone men called the Dredge.  They suddenly begin a massive invasion that sweeps the entire continent into chaos.  As the protagonist you’re trying to get your people to safety.  Every encounter gets more desperate as you have fewer fighters and Dredge armies multiply.  If their thick armor and massive numbers aren’t bad enough, they also have immortal champions that can single handedly win battles. As the protagonist you have two races on your team:  humans and Varls.  Varls are giants, endomorphic men with horns protruding from their foreheads.   Varl are slow, plodding juggernauts of destruction.   Humans are quick and nimble fighters who usually can’t handle attritional combat. As more Varl and human cities are sacked there are more refugees, more bandits, and less supplies.  You are a human named Rook who is not only trying to save the remaining members of his villagers but trying to help everyone else fleeing the tide of darkness.  As the leader you have to make difficult decisions that can drastically affect your caravan.  Do you help the group of refugees on the side of the road?  Maybe they’ll join and be loyal and contribute.  Maybe they’ll just kill you in your sleep and run off with supplies.Unfortunately I can’t figure out the name of the studio’s proprietary engine.  However according to an article from Develop-Online.  They’re total bros by sharing their technology.  (http://www.develop-online.net/interview/why-stoic-games-is-sharing-the-banner-saga-s-game-engine/0212308) For an indie game the mechanics are on point.  The frame rate is great.  There were no visual bugs that I saw. Unfortunately for the sound however there were some issues.  For long stretches of the game I’d have no sound, either background music or sound effects.Luckily I didn’t much mind the loss of sound because the visuals were stunning.  The characters and side scrolling backgrounds were hand drawn.  They are so meticulously drawn, so many details added to even the backgrounds.  The emotions and mental states are delivered so well on the protagonists. The first few chapters of the story start off a bit slow.  You’re introduced to the mechanics and to a lot of characters.  With so many characters and jumping around you don’t form any attachments until roughly the 5th or 6th chapter.  However once those attachments are attached they’re deep and only get deeper.  As the game progresses you feel the stress of leadership weigh more heavily on your shoulders.  You’re trying to get your people safe and everything in the world seems to be falling apart.  At times every decision you make seems to be the wrong one.  You keep a brave front when talking to your caravan but deep down doubt has set in and you start to think no one will make it.  Eventually you may become hardened and intent on self-preservation, stealing and murdering from all others you run across, just so your caravan can survive one more day.  People will die, others will abandon or even betray you and the caravan. I haven’t felt that sort of intensity since Mass Effect 3. Overall this is a fantastic game.  One of the best I’ve played, ever.  This is a game that brings in a big breath of fresh air that the game industry has been needing.  I didn’t talk much about the Dredge because they are mysterious with and I don’t want to spoil anything. Scoring, this is definitely a Game of the Year candidate.  If you don’t already own this game you are messing up.",76,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,3.0,0.0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,16.0,3.0,3.0,79.0
The Banner Saga 2,Xbox One,"Stoic Jester Studios, Stoic","['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Tactics']",T,2016-07-01,"Great game. Perfect if you like turn based strategy games. It's story is mostly text based, with cut scenes for choices. The game is listed at $15 bucks on Steam, but XB1 gold members get it this month for free.  IMO it is easily worth the $15 bucks. I think it's Indie, but it feels higher tier. It's got all of the good stuff you expect from a Turn based strategy game. It does have it's flaws, like... No diagonal attacks. Which I find odd, especially for ranged. Too short of caster/archer range. It's 6 squares, but when the Varl take up 4 squares, you see how limited that is. Literally it feels like using a caster is a punishment. And I love casters in these types of games. Healers heal armor and not health (virtually every attack ignores armor) Thus healers are virtually useless. If they healed health, I would always use one. Them seem pointless except for pushing the story and doing these amazing magics, that none of them posses when you control them. Sometimes the game forces you to have a character for a boss fight. It's usually fine, but when this requires a specific tactic, which is usually just a pain in the butt and less effective than even a basic zerge. You will literally wonder why it was put in, as it literally makes the fight tedious. No ability to spin the camera that I can find. Controls don't seem optimized for consoles. Other than that it is quite an enjoyable game. It's flaws are small, and what it does have, makes up for it's weaknesses.",84,Generally favorable reviews,8.0,0.0,0.0,7.8,Generally favorable reviews,14.0,2.0,2.0,78.0

The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,Xbox One,NeocoreGames,"['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG']",T,2017-12-29,"I must admit that I’ve really enjoyed The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series and I was pleased to learn that the third instalment was making its way to console. This instalment follows the same path as the previous two game’s, which means it has problems but it is a decent game to sink quite a few hours into. The story in the game is as good as ever and the best thing is that it remains interesting and pretty much satisfies you at every turn. The gameplay in the game has once again been done very well and the mechanics combine perfectly and hold up really well the whole way through. I was however a little disappointed to learn that once again there is a level cap and I would have definitely liked a little more freedom. The reason I would have liked more freedom is because there are a number of different classes for you try and each class has been done very well, but unfortunately you don’t get the full benefit of each class because of the level cap. Another problem with the game is that it can be a little too complicated at times and the descriptions they give you often don’t help with the problems that you face. Exploring in the game can be very fun at times and finding loot can be a real treat, but some of the loot you come across is pretty much useless and this can be a little disheartening at times. The presentation side of the game follows the usual formula of the previous game’s and I’m glad they continued in this way. Visually the game can look great at times and the accompanying sound design does an excellent job of making your time with the game very immersive. At the end of the day if you’re a fan of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series then you will be once again pleased with what’s on offer here. They don’t however do anything spectacular and the content in the game is content that you’ve probably seen hundreds of times, and that in my opinion is the game’s biggest problem. Don’t get me wrong they do a wonderful job with the mechanics in the game, but the shortcomings the game suffers with definitely stop it from reaching its full potential. Shortcomings aside though the game does just enough to get a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk,Xbox One,Fizbin,"['Adventure', 'General']",E10+,2017-10-24,"The Inner World first launched in 2013 to critical acclaim, with a story that is touched on in the opening as well as through dialogue as you progress through The Last Wind Monk. Essentially, after Robert’s (main character from the first game) victory over the evil Conroy, he runs away from the responsibilities he’s faced with and is petrified by one of the Basilisks he saved everyone from. Three years later, your trusty companion Peck, who is a pigeon, finally decides to bring you back from what could be considered death. Why he waited three years to do so is beyond me. So from the get go, this is a point-and-click adventure that offers more than one character to control, and eventually gives three at any given time, each with their own abilities and tasks to conquer. Peck is obviously able to go where Robert and Laura cannot, while Laura plays the muscle, and Robert plays the timid coward that has no idea what is going on, and more or less serves as the vehicle for new players to learn what happened originally while also discovering the events since. The game has a lot of dialogue, as the genre is known for being story heavy with puzzles. The voice work overall is pretty solid, although that’s not to say that I enjoyed all of it. Robert in particular grates on my ears, as his personality isn’t one I really care for. However, it’s well executed and certainly lends itself to his persona. Likewise, Laura’s voice actress has a very confident sound that parallels her skills, which is a much needed reprieve from the nasal-based whine you’ll become all too familiar with. The puzzles are fairly unique, given the fact that you’ll have three different characters to use throughout. Luckily, for those that are slightly less puzzle savvy, the game offers a pretty extensive hint system. It can be as vague as mentioning a possibility, or as thorough as a step-by-step guide online you’d follow. The detail is up to you, and lets you choose how you want to experience the game. If you are here simply for the continuation of the story and hate puzzles, you can use it as a “see the content mode.” However, most people will attain their enjoyment from this while figuring out the puzzles, so merely seeing what you’re supposed to be doing will suffice as a hint. The game’s controls, whether this was unique to me or not, seemed a bit off. I couldn’t interact with the environment unless I had pulled up the hot-spots. While I appreciate seeing what I can interact with, I don’t like being able to move about freely if I’m going to be forced to scroll through the points of interest with the bumpers, and then choose what I want to do with the object in question. It seems a bit backwards, as these should merely be there to help you locate something you missed, not something you are required to look at to play the game. The game’s aesthetic is unique, as it’s very cartoony. Whenever I see it, I want to say it looks like something made in Flash, but only the characters because of the bold use of color and simplicity of the character designs. Quite honestly, I’m amazed by how simple they are, yet how unique they look when paired against each other. The backgrounds are lovingly put together, perhaps a bit reminiscent of some Daedalic titles. My biggest issue with the art is some of the animations you’ll see. At the very beginning of the game before you are even given the chance to play, you see a cutscene where someone starts to boo – it zooms into the person and the animation shown is a generic talking cycle; there is only one sound coming from his mouth. This may seem minor, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. There are many instances where the animations aren’t up to par, but this was one of the stand outs as it just seemed lazy. If you played The Inner World, I can certainly see the appeal of the story and what the characters have to offer. I’m sure there are plenty of callbacks that you’ll appreciate that I wasn’t able to, such as characters and locations. As someone that came into this fresh, it’s a fun game, but a bit lacking overall. The cheery art contrasted by the dark themes the game covers comes across nicely, but those themes aren’t always portrayed in the best possible way. The character differences makes the puzzles more in-depth than some other options currently available in the genre, but with part of the cast being unlikable (most of the time for me, at least), it’s diff",0,No score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The Jackbox Party Pack 2,Xbox One,"Jackbox Games, Inc.","['Miscellaneous', 'Party / Minigame']",T,2015-10-13,"Fibbage 2 is a big part of the reason to pick up this party pack.  The original fibbage was limited and was something my friends and I chewed through after ~30 game sessions split into 2/3 nights.  Knowing that there is at least twice the question content makes me feel better about having this second party pack, and the new games have their moments as well.  The biggest oddity to these party packs is, why bother releasing a new game when you can release expansions?  Fibbage is a sure-thing for a party with up to 8 players going at it simultaneously, BS'ing each other.  That's what makes the game so addicting.  Instead of ""hundreds"" of questions (the advertising on the website claims ~500 questions in Fibbage 2), Fibbage needs at least double that to really have staying power, and while fact-finding for these questions can consume time, I'm certain there's more than enough source material to get the question content up to that level.  At that point, questions you've seen the answers to will be so far & few between that you may not remember the answer, making for a much longer enjoyment period.  Quiplash XL seems to be the other strong contender here, but the other games that have some appeal don't quite have the immediate fun-factor.  Instead of tossing in 5 games, offering 2-3 high quality, highly replayable games makes more sense.

The Jackbox Party Pack 4,Xbox One,"Jackbox Games, Inc.","['Miscellaneous', 'Party / Minigame']",T,2017-10-20,"The Jackbox games are an incredible amount of fun and are absolutely perfect to play with your friends and family. The game’s never take themselves seriously and this definitely adds to the fun factor. The Jackbox Party Pack 4 is a good addition to the series and it will give you some very enjoyable moments, but unfortunately I feel it’s lacking when compared to the other game’s in the series. I do however like the little tweaks they’ve implemented on the Fibbage game, and I feel like these tweaks have given Fibbage a whole new lease of life. There are five games for you to choose from and each game has a lot of variety which means boredom doesn’t set in very quickly. Not all game’s are fun though and this is especially the case with the Monster Seeking Monster game. I found this game to be pretty lacklustre because it takes a long time to complete and this makes this particular game lose its appeal quite quickly. As ever the game’s allow you to have a huge number of players playing at the same time and this in turn makes parties and gatherings perfect to play these games at. I did however notice that some game’s suffered with a few technichal problems, and this was very frustrating when I was trying to get my answer to register. The presentation side of the game is something that really tickled my fancy. Visually the game has a lot of variety going for it and the sound design makes you become immersed in the game and better yet makes you have more fun. At the end of the day The Jackbox Party Pack 4 is definitely the weakest game in the series, but it still manages to make you have a good time. There are a decent mix of game’s to keep you occupied but in my opinion there isn’t much that makes this addition stand out. Fans of The Jackbox Party Pack series will definitely find some enjoyment here however, but if you’re a newbie to the series then I suggest you play the other game’s in the series before purchasing this game.",84,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

On the whole the game can be very enjoyable at times, but it’s not one of the best LEGO games ever and it can be lacking at times. The world they have created for this game is brilliant and it feels alive in all areas. There is always something for you to do and the characters are very interesting. The characters would have been even better with better voice acting, but unfortunately they miss the mark here. The biggest inclusion in this game is the couch co-op versus mode, which is something I have wanted for a while. Thankfully they’ve done this mode justice and it delivers an incredible amount of fun time and time again. There is plenty for you to explore in this game and they do a good job of making exploring feel rewarding with gold bricks etc. Unfortunately when exploring you will find that the loading times seem to go on forever and this definitely frustrates you, a patch is needed here in my opinion. The combat in the game has seen a vast improvement, and the new moves they have included definitely pack a punch. The combat would have been even better if it wasn’t for the awkward camera. The camera can be a big problem at times and it caused me many frustrating moments when on a mission. At the end of the day as far as LEGO games go The LEGO NINJAGO Movie Video Game is a good addition to the genre, but unfortunately it’s not one of the most memorable LEGO games. It does have some interesting and different ideas, but it’s plagued with a few niggling problems that can cause you a great deal of frustration.

They have managed to nail a lot of the required mechanics and this makes the game both fun and very addictive. Another very good thing they’ve done is that they’ve included a lot of variety in a lot of areas, and this keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. There are multiple enemies for you to take on and each one has a unique quirk, and they allow you a number of different weapons for you to take these enemies on with. If you like a game that allows you to explore at your own pace then The Mummy Demastered has you covered. The world in the game is vast and there are lots of things for you to discover, which in turn gives the game some replay value. If you like an old-school challenge then this game will give you that as well. I liked the challenge but I must admit that some of the bosses were extremely difficult and I lost my cool quite a few times when taking them on. I would have also liked to have had my health restored when reaching save points, but unfortunately they don’t do that so prepare to die a lot. Responsive controls is very important in a game like this and thankfully they’ve done a wonderful job of keeping everything responsive. The presentation side of the game is awesome and I absolutely loved it. The visuals have a lovely looking old-school style and the accompanying soundtrack makes the game stand out a lot. At the end of the day whenever WayForward brings a game out I know I will love it because they always put a huge amount of effort into their product, and that’s exactly what they’ve done with The Mummy Demastered. This game will definitely keep you addicted and fans of retro style games will love playing this, in fact I think this game will create more fans of the old-school style.

The Pinball Arcade,Xbox One,Farsight Studios,"['Action', 'Miscellaneous', 'Parlor', 'Pinball']",E10+,2014-11-26,"Pinball Arcade was originally released on the Xbox 360 in 2012. Due to a long running legal dispute this game was eventually withdrawn from the Xbox 360 store (having only released two DLC's in the time it was there) with no sign it would ever come back or have further DLC's released.So it was a great surprise to see it released on the Xbox One, with a graphical upgrade and all the tables that should have been released in the past two years!Pinball Arcade itself is free, and comes with the excellent Arabian Nights table to get you started. You can try any of the other 30+ tables as a demo, and either purchase them individually if you like, or as a 'value' pack so there's a lot to look at.The tables are all real-life replicas, with all the detail and gameplay meticulously crafted with astonishing attention. For example, the lighting on the tables has had a significant upgrade from the 360 version. I personally like to play all my tables with the 'dark room' setting as it really increases the realism on the Xbox One.The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from the Xbox 360, but it really didn't have to. The ball mechanics are absolutely spot on, and the little metal balls actually feel, well, just like they should do, with weight and inertia, which in turn makes Pinball Arcade fast and frantic.I do, however recommend that if you have a Samsung TV/Monitor, that you set it to 'Game Mode', otherwise screen latency will be a problem, and that is not documented anywhere.While other pinball games are available, Pinball Arcade is where I spend my money. It just plays 'right' and scores massively on realism, nostalgia and fun.Oh lastly, I looked at buying The Addams Family Pinball. A mint concourse example would be £8500 to you sir. For ONE table.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,Xbox One,The Astronauts,"['Adventure', '3D', 'First-Person']",M,2018-01-19,"The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you wont be able to see them. You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethans home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters. Still, the discoveries wont happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Pauls supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy. Key Features: *    Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley, which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments.*    Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethans disappearance -- and the fate of his family.*    Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction, all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft.*    Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace. Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease.",78,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Through this you can see Clem through Gabe. The game has left too much for people to desire so I think that there will be another season based on this storyline in the future with Javier, Gabe and Clementine involved. I'd recommend this game to a player who wants to sink their teeth in to a juicy game series...

The Way,Xbox One,Code Horizon,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2017-08-04,"Imagine a love unlike any other. Maybe it’s who you’re with right now, or maybe it’s someone you’ll meet in the future. You find your soulmate, the one that you couldn’t imagine living without. You spend almost all of your waking time together, at home and at work. You travel the galaxy with them, studying the societies of alien species, and even interacting with them side by side. They complete you entirely, and suddenly, they die. Death is already a hard concept to come to terms with for most, but it’s impossible to do so when an alien world speaks of eternal life. Would you be willing to give up everything in the hopes of bringing your love back to life? The Way has a very dark, emotional opening that will likely drive you to completing the game. You dig up your wife’s grave and put her corpse in a capsule, steal a ship from your place of employment, and fly off to a planet in the hopes of bringing her back to life. You’ll spend time with alien organisms, learn about the explorer’s past, and solve puzzles which may or may not requiring precise movements lest you fall victim to death. But don’t worry; with a game that takes influence from Another World, you’re bound to die over and over. From the get go, you’ll realize this is the type of game with puzzles that you’ll either be doing trial and error for, or you’ll be taking notes as you go along. Instead of writing down notes like I used to year ago, I resorted to taking pictures with my phone – nonetheless, these are the types of puzzles that are the most rewarding. Hints about lemons as descriptors, codes for sequences, and abilities later on that force you to do a lot of back and forth while timing things perfectly. Other games with notable influence here are Flashback and Heart of Darkness, with a heavy use of the y-axis in some levels. With puzzles involving a shield to reflect light or lasers, teleportation to get past locked areas, telekinesis to move blocks and create projections or simply allow your four legged friend to tag along, there’s a lot of mind exercises contained within. You’ll face large beasts that will require your wits to defeat, and plenty of platforming that may seem unfair at times. Just know that it’s doable with time, and maybe a few spare controllers. The game has plenty of jokes that you may or may not be able to appreciate, depending on your exposure to Science Fiction. One of the first ones that made me chuckle was the name of the ship you commandeer, although I only recall it being mentioned on a computer screen. There are also some characters that appear to be nods to the old LucasArts point-and-click games that Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert worked on. The final boss will even test your twitch-like reflexes with something you likely would never expect based on the rest of the game. And make sure to stay after the credits, as there is an answer to something you’ll notice throughout the game that is never properly addressed. Control wise, the game plays fairly well. Aside from some frustrating portions due to button prompts not doing what you expect (namely the shield not being deployed despite you pressing the right trigger), everything worked fine, if not a bit clunky. Platforming itself is less than ideal, as you’ll often go too far when falling or jumping, meaning you have to time it just right, if not be a bit short so that you climb up. Amusingly, I fell from higher up than I should have and landed where the climb animation would initiate, so I climbed up the side of a cliff and then died. That climb was exhausting. However, while the platforming is less than perfect, it fits right in with the games that inspire it, although that certainly appeals to a niche audience. The main draw here really is the story, although the many puzzles offered certainly add to it. There’s plenty of emotional weight from the very beginning, and you run into more later on, although it’s an expected outcome from something like this. Regrettably, the intrigue in puzzle solving felt in the first couple hours seems to disappear later on as trial and error becomes a much more common trait. Luckily, the repetitive nature found in the latter portion is met with different landscapes as the environments are lovingly crafted, ranging from modern day to alien deserts, forests, and cityscapes. If you’ve been searching for a new puzzle platformer, this may be for you. If you like the art direction, questioning the meaning of life, and projecting yourself on characters that have to make big decisions, I’d say you’ll quite enjoy this. However, if you struggle with puzzles, precise platforming, and simply don’t have the patience for trial and error gameplay, you might want to wait to play this, if you pick it up at all. Overall, The Way is an emotional adventure that is told exceptionally with plenty of head scratching to boot.",0,No score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The question is: how far will you go to make it through another day? This War of Mine: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also the fact that even in times of conflict, kids are still kids - they laugh, cry, play with toys and see the world differently.

Now, with its 3rd DLC release, The Last Stand attempts to offer more in the way of controlled PvP encounters and a new incursion. Sure, if you love The Division (for whatever reason) and love the chaos of the Dark Zone, Last Stand is exactly what you're wanting more of. The 8v8 gametype puts you in a closed-off section of the Dark Zone and has you fighting for control over 3 different plots (think territories from Halo or Gears of War). While the action has potential, it's still going to screw newer players over by forcing them to engage with other agents that are far-better equipped (gear-wise). This will make it very tough to stick with the Last Stand section of this DLC as it's going to take at least 10 games to properly outfit out-of-date players. There are other aspects to this DLC besides the PvP add-on, but it's the highlight as an incursion is only good for about a week or two before people master them and move on. This is also the FINAL DLC for the season pass holders, and it's a mediocre one. Everything Massive (Ubisoft) has done with this game has been a dramatic under-deliverance of content and story expansion. The narrative is completely buried and the joys of cooperative play feel long gone. The Division, at first, was full of promise and grand scale. But after the shine began to wear off, the game has held little appeal. Hopefully a sequel is in the works with a far-better development team, because had The Division delivered on its promise, it would be a game I'd still be diving into multiple times per week. Today marked the first day I had played it in 2017 and I doubt I'll play it for more than a couple days as Ghost Recon: Wildlands is about to release and it has plenty in common with The Division, minus the multitude of bugs and a fantastic cooperative approach. I wouldn't recommend this DLC to anyone other than die-hard Division fans. It's just not worth your money and time.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.3,Generally unfavorable reviews,1.0,1.0,2.0,43.0

Toro,Xbox One,Recotechnology S.L.,"['Sports', 'Individual', 'Other']",T,2015-05-15,"Review by Leighw.co.uk (Freelance Gaming journalist) Bullfighting is one of those sports activities that still raises many question marks over the well-being or in certain regions intentional death of the bulls. So when I knew that Toro, a bullfighting simulation was heading to Xbox one I was eager to see how it would be portrayed in the non harmful digital world of the Xbox One. After a short intro sequence you find yourself on the main menu with the only option starting career mode, during which the first two levels are embedded with a tutorial to explain the techniques required. After that you can head back to the main menu which has options a quick game allowing you to select an arena of your choice and the opposing bull. There's also an even more pointless training mode, which does a pretty good job of repeating what you're forced to endure in career mode. For the light-hearted there's two separate mini-games to try, both are certainly mini, one see's you pressing alternate buttons to build power before hitting another to select the angle as your bull fires a bullfighter into the air, Secondly you have a 'quick time event' as you attempt to break through as many doors as possible, this rather repetitive QTE gives you increasingly shorter times to press the required button, get it right, you break the door, fail and..... well, you fail. Both Mini Games have an achievement attached, but with no other challenges or leaderboard these will literally last you a few minutes before you head back to the main menu knowing your unlikely to visit them again. The last few menu items are options, gallery and credits.  Options cover the basics allowing tweaks to sound, language and contrast and the gallery allows you to view all the items in the game including the costumes, most of which look very similar. The bulls, most of which look very similar and even bullrings which at least two of, have some quite distinct differences, apart from a big circle of dirt in the middle, that's still the same. Obviously the credits serve their purpose to give the developers a little recognition for their work on the title. So we head back to the Career mode, and let's start by saying, it's certainly not a story mode, because there is no story, you're plonked into the ring of a small and quiet bullring to learn two basic moves for evading there's some glossy names for various twists and turns all controlled by holding LT to face the bull and then a combination of two buttons, and I'm sure Bullfighting aficionados will know far more about these than I do, but I don't mind admitting that like 90% of people who are probably reading this, my knowledge of Bullfighting is sparse to say the least, so maybe they didn't want to confuse us with details or background information. Your career consists of about 25 events, which see you face a bull in a selection of mini-games, the first with a large cape, allows you to choose up to 4 of your favorite 2 button commands and then tasks you with repeating them consistently until the timer runs down, If you get a combo of moves without getting hit, then your points rack up but so does the bull's anger meter, this then initiates a quick time event. Here you simply press a combination of buttons as they pop up on the screen and then upon completion the bull suddenly chills out and starts charging as normal, other than breaking up your combo this also gives the crowd a small boost although they seem to make more noise when the bull runs straight into you. This same sequence is repeated later with a small single-handed cape, thankfully you can choose a complete separate list of two button commands which look very similar, and often have exactly the same commands but hey, at least they have a different fancy name. As well as this you have the part of Spanish bullfighting which is most controversial of all, first you stab two small barbed flags into the bulls shoulders in real the real world this would be to further anger the bull but weaken it too forcing its head to drop for the finale of stabbing the bull behind its head with a small sword. These two rather unneccessary sections are both simple button commands and don't really offer anything to the game, there's no congratulatory bulls ear for an exceptional performance, nor is the bull ever pardoned for a life as a stud, you simply kill the bull and move on. Thankfully due tot he lack of any cut-scene after the intro, there's no gory scenes, no blood splatter on the screen, and with graphics looking closer to the original Xbox than the Xbox One, it's almost good that the graphics and presentations are so poor. As you've probably guessed, I've not enjoyed my time with Toro, I'm sure it will appeal to a few people and if you have the patience to tolerate the repetitiveness then there's enough to keep you occupied for more than an evening, but I feel that far more could have been done with a game about bullfighting.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0
TorqueL: Physics Modified Edition,Xbox One,FullPowerSideAttack.com,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2017-10-17,"The puzzle platformer genre has been saturated a great deal over recent years and the abundance of games can be quite tiring. In order to stop the tiresome feeling the game must stand out from the rest and unfortunately that’s not the case with ToequeL: Physics Modified Edition. While the movement mechanic may make the gameplay stand out and make it exciting at times it’s unfortunately the only thing the gameplay has and the lack of variety soon makes the game become tedious. There is also a lack of content in the game and this without a doubt lowers the replay value considerably. The difficulty curve in the game spikes out of nowhere and this definitely makes you enjoy the game less and then eventually you don’t want to play the game any more. I did however like the game’s simplistic approach and if they would have made the pick up and play style combine with an easier progress then the game would have provided much more enjoyment. I do however appreciate the realistic approach of the physics in the game and I think I would have enjoyed it more if it didn’t take as long to restart a level. When you die it takes too long to get back into the level and this just left me feeling frustrated and deflated. The presentation side of the game is dull throughout and offers nothing memorable. I get that they wanted to keep things minamilist in design, but maybe they went a bit too minamilist in their approach. At the end of the day TorqueL: Physics Modified Edition is another game that can be put in the below average category of puzzle platformers, and there are many games in that pile. Unfortunately the game offers nothing new and it has too many problems so you don’t end up having much fun with this title. In a genre that’s littered with games TorqueL doesn’t do enough to make itself different and there are much better games in the genre so ultimately it doesn’t get a recommendation from me.",0,No score yet,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The game offers you both single player action and multiplayer and without a doubt the best way to play this game is in the latter. Don’t get me wrong the single player offering isn’t bad it’s just that it’s nowhere near as fun as it is when played in local or online multiplayer. I will say though that the online multiplayer does suffer with a few problems and the most noticeable problem was the lag, which did cause me a few premature deaths from time to time. The amount of content in this game is simply fantastic and with the added bonus of user generated content this means you will playing this game for a long time to come. Playing this long would make you think that you will no doubt end up getting bored, but amazingly that’s not the case. The main reason why you don’t end up getting bored is because the level design has a huge amount of variety going for it and this means things will stay interesting and fresh for some time to come. The presentation side of the game isn’t spectacular nor does it need to be because what they’re offering is perfect for the style of the game. The visuals and sound design are packed full of humour and this definitely makes the game even more of a blast to play. At the end of the day Ultimate Chicken Horse is a game that has all the things I love about local multiplayer game’s. There is just so much fun to be had with this game that it will without a doubt take a lot of your time up, and I should know because I have already sunk multiple hours into it and I just want to keep playing it. If you like local multiplayer game’s then Ultimate Chicken Horse is a must buy in fact I can see this game bringing more fans to the local multiplayer genre, which is a testament to how good the game is.",0,No score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Verdun,Xbox One,"M2H, Blackmill Games","['Action', 'Shooter', 'First-Person', 'Arcade']",M,2017-03-08,"Verdun, a game I previously covered on this site for PS4. The Xbox version is, I must say a step up from that of the PS4 due to a healthy delay in which the game could have only been nurtured further for the good of long geverty. This is good, the Devs held the game back to benefit its initial launch. I digress as there are a few odd hiccups which are not game breaking, some enemies may be textureless and just pink or white and even then when I confronted Mike Hergaarden (A Verdun Dev) about the bug he responded stating the bug had been fixed and a patch is on the way which I'm assuming will contain the Scottish troops or 'lady's of hell'. As far a players, there are plenty of matches to be found on the US and EU server browsers with a total of 2,000 players between them, the PS4 had a mere fraction of this upon release back in August last year with around 100 and a peak of 400 players. It's clear that the Xbox one version has attracted quite a sizeable community, and a passionate one at that, it's not surprising for its not often we get a pc to console port quite as good as this one seeing as most companies make a port, make their money then leave with little to no post launch content/patches *cough* valve *cough*In fact we received all past content that the pc players had received prior to console release such as the horrors of war update which goes to show these developers were keen on giving us a full experience. Lastly let's talk game modes/maps, there are 4 game modes 2 of which are just fps standards like team deathmatch and free for all, then there's the juicy ones, the reasons you buy this game, squad defence and  frontlines, frontlines being a typical ww1 scenario with both sides fighting for trenches in a tug of war affair and squad defence being a mode in which you and a squad of 3 others fend off against large quantities of enemies In waves and may I say it makes you feel like a total badass war veteran especially when you and your squad are mowing down enemies inside your trench while you cover each other and move asa group. So if you're sick of generic boring shooters and space energy laser phazer ass beams, come along and join the fight, especially if you're a history buff like me, you'll love the authentic ww1 weaponry and the loading screen trivia.

Vesta,Xbox One,FinalBoss Games,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",E,2018-01-19,"Puzzle platformers have been going for a long time now and I must confess that I actually quite enjoy them because I don’t find them to taxing, which is nice. Vesta is the latest game to enter the puzzle adventure genre and for the most part it holds up pretty well and it can deliver some enjoyable moments despite the niggling problems it has. Something that really impressed me about this game was the level design. The levels in the game are full of variety and that means things don’t become boring, which is great. The gameplay has a lot of different mechanics in play at the same time and they all hold up really well, and I must admit that I was especially impressed with the character-swapping mechanic. The game also boasts quite a few different puzzles and whilst none of them are bad in design I found them to be a little on the easy side and I was craving more of a challenge. An important aspect in a game like this is how the controls hold up, and thankfully they hold up really well. They keep things simple when it comes to the controls and this means you can focus on the tasks at hand and the best thing is that these tasks never cause you problems because everything remains responsive throughout. Unfortunately everything isn’t all plain sailing in the game though and it does suffer with a few technical issues. The main issue I came across was the saving feature because sometimes it doesn’t always save and if you die you can lose a lot of progress, which is very frustrating to say the least. The presentation side of the game is nothing special but it is something that I enjoyed. Visually the game has a nice look to it and it has quite a bit of charm going for it. The sound design is also charming and it never once got on my nerves, which is a bonus. At the end of the day Vesta is a game that provided me with quite a bit of fun and in a way I wanted a little more. Unfortunately there isn’t much content for you to sink your teeth into and with no multiplayer modes the replay value is quite low, which is a shame. I will say though that the content it does have is pretty good and it does enough to get a recommendation from me.",66,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Wasteland 2: Director's Cut,Xbox One,InXile Entertainment,"['Role-Playing', 'Western-Style']",M,2015-10-13,"Wasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition. Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.",77,Generally favorable reviews,10.0,3.0,0.0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,37.0,6.0,15.0,71.0

Bad Medicine follows the trail of a dangerous ransomware that has crippled the city’s hospitals; as Marcus and his crew dig deeper to stop this menace, they will cross paths with deadly hitman Jordi Chin and form an unlikely alliance against the Russian mafia. Caustic Progress unveils a strange new company called RenSense that is experimenting with dangerous nanotech on the Bay Area's homeless. It has caught the attention of bio-hacker Lenni, who claims that their mobile clinics for the homeless hide very troubling human experiments. With her help, DedSec sets out to stop this madness.

Wheel of Fortune,Xbox One,Ubisoft,"['Miscellaneous', 'Trivia / Game Show']",E,2017-11-07,"I love games that allow you to relax and let you have fun with friends and family, and that’s exactly what you get here. This version of Wheel of Fortune is the best version in my opinion, but it does still suffer with a few problems. Without a doubt the game is best enjoyed when playing with friends and family in local multiplayer, and thankfully the local multiplayer plays really well. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for the online part of the game because it’s very difficult to get into a game and often feels broken, which is a shame. In fact the game on the whole suffers with a few technical issues and things like crashing and lag can take away from the fun factor at times. I will say however that they have done a very good job with the variety when it comes to the puzzles, and the best thing is that I’ve yet to have the same puzzle twice. I was also a big fan of the character creator in the game and you can have a lot of fun when mixing and matching the different items. I wasn’t however a fan of the camera in the game and I was surprised how bad it was at times because you can’t always see the wheel properly which is stupid. The presentation side of the game is without a doubt the best a Wheel of Fortune game has seen to date. Visually the game looks just like it does in real life, and the sound design is pretty good as well if you look past the annoying host. At the end of the day if you’re a fan of quiz and puzzle game’s then you will definitely find more than enough enjoyment here. As far as Wheel of Fortune games go it’s quite a good addition to the series, and it would have been even better if it didn’t have so many annoying problems.

White Noise 2,Xbox One,Milkstone Studios,"['Action Adventure', 'Survival']",M,2017-09-01,"White Noise 2Decently Fun but extremely unbalancedWhite Noise 2 is a 4 v 1 survival game where you play as either an investigator or a monster…as an investigator your job is to find all 8 clue around the map, from tapes, to chests, to close a portal and end a match..Every character has their own stats and more are unlocked as you level up...investigators have a flash light, the ability to yell to tell other players where they are, the ability to throw glow sticks to slow the monster down.. And they have a compass to point them in the direction of the nearest clue…And as the monster your goal is to kill every player before they can find all clues…There are a variety of monsters for different play styles with their own abilities like teleporting behind the nearest investigator, turning off their lights, or teleporting to the nearest secret for example… though all have a compass pointing to the nearest investigator..However this game is extremely unbalanced in favor of the monster…There wasn’t 1 match I played where the investigators won…as an investigator you have to deal with conserving batteries despite enemies being able to detect you better when your light is on… this is balance enough.. having to manage a battery is unnecessary…flashlights are annoying but not over powered… as again monsters can choose their respawn points if you force a teleport on them with your light, one of them is unaffected if they stay still.. You can force them to go out… it’s just unfairThe compass on the investigator side only gives you a direction for a couple seconds and disappears and takes forever to cool down...I get it that you have 4 players so you can take turns with the compass, but it’s hard to communicate a plan without a mic,I don’t think the compass should be unlimited, but at the very least the cool down should be cut in half especially if you’re asking them to manage their batteries…The monster also has to ability to summon idols to go off when characters are near a location as if their compass wasn’t enough.. And these idols can make the investigator lose their sanity and go crazy...You can save people from the monster if they’re caught... but after the first investigator is killed, every kill after is basically an instakill… giving you no chance to save your partner… but this ridiculous unbalance forces players to stick together, you can’t split up and collect clues, because one death essentially sabotages the rest of the team…Once you are dead you’re still in the game as a ghost..and as a ghost you can still communicate and you have flame to help players escape the monster and guide them to the nearest clue as you can see the map much better than them…but it just isn’t enough to even the playing field…Don’t get me wrong… I enjoyed trying to win as the investigator side...it just feels so impossible…The most fun is being the monster and using your abilities and listening to people trash talk you while you hunt them down…but being the monster is so easy that at times I felt bad for the other team…White Noise 2 is a cool concept.. It just needs tons of balancing…I give White Noise 2a 5/10",0,No score yet,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Wulverblade,Xbox One,Darkwind Media,"['Action', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", '2D']",M,2018-01-31,"I must admit that I have a soft spot for hack and slash game’s, and I have had a number of enjoyable moments playing beat ’em up’s over the year’s. Unfortunately there has been many decent beat ’em up’s in recent year’s, but thankfully Wulverblade has made me realise why I enjoy this specific genre so much. The gameplay is absolutely fantastic and it never gets dull, which is great. Everything about the combat works flawlessly and whilst the difficulty can be a problem at times it still didn’t stop me from jumping straight back into the game. Something that really impressed me with Wulverblade was the story it delivers. The story is a wonderful tale and it does a great job of keeping you hooked throughout, and a big part of that is down to the writing and the fantastic voice actors. In terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you occupied. There is also an abundance of unlockables for you to collect and collecting all of these gives the game quite a lot of replay value. An important thing in a game like this is the maps that are included, and thankfully they get this spot on. There are an array of maps for you to battle on and each map has a lot of variety going for it, so it was a pleasure trying each map out. The game doesn’t really suffer with many problems and my only real complaint is that the small technical issues can take away from the game’s charm, but thankfully these issues don’t happen very often. The presentation side of the game is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Visually the game has an art style that’s packed full of charm and they really do make the gameplay stand out. The sound design is also fantastic and the immersion levels due to the sound design can be off the charts at times. At the end of the day Wulverblade has brought back a lot of fond memories for me and it made me realise just how much I love this genre. They’ve done this by integrating each different mechanic perfectly and there really isn’t anything bad about the game, which is great. Fans of the beat ’em up style will fall in love with this immediately and with the amount of content the game offers you, you won’t be getting bored for quite a while and ultimately it gets a massive thumbs up from me.",79,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,3.0,0.0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,4.0,0.0,1.0,74.0

Wuppo manages to do all of these things and without a doubt it’s one of the most enjoyable indie game’s I’ve played this year. The story in the game fits in perfectly with the gameplay, and the best thing about it is that it’s packed full of humour and charm. The world in the game works very well with the story and I loved how much the world was alive, which in turn made me want to explore even more. I was very fond of the gameplay in the game and I especially liked the combat. The combat is fun and exciting throughout and the most important thing is that it remained responsive throughout. I will say though that the game does have difficulty spikes and these spikes can make you become a little frustrated because they seem to come out of nowhere. I also found the controls to be a little fiddly and awkward at times, but thankfully that only occurred when I was dealing with a full inventory. One of my favourite things about the game were the boss fights. You can tell that a great deal of effort has gone into the bosses and they definitely have a unique side to them. The presentation side of the game is also unique and certain things make the game stand out quite a bit. This is especially the case with the visuals, and the art style that’s used here is brilliant and makes you love the game even more. At the end of the day Wuppo offers you an adventure that’s charming and very very addictive. It’s a game that can be enjoyed by gamers of all ages and I must admit that me and my family had a great time with the game. It does have a few niggling problems every now and then, but you quickly forget about them because the game gets so much right. If you’re looking for something that’s fun, charming and at times very unique then look no further than Wuppo.",75,Generally favorable reviews,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament,Xbox One,DOMO Studio,"['Role-Playing', 'Japanese-Style']",T,2018-01-24,"In ancient times long ago, in order to find his beloved missing daughter, the divine Jade Emperor opened the gates of heaven, allowing a direct connection between heaven and earth. This was done, so that worthy mortals could appeal to the Jade Emperor and obtain divine powers, to aid in the search of his missing daughter. However, this gift was exploited and taken advantage of, causing chaos in the mortal realm. The Nine Li Tribe became a cult that worshipped demons and practiced in the occult, divorcing themselves from the businesses of the mortal realm.Forces of evil suddenly arose, inciting wars across the continent, condemning people into a life of fears and sufferings.Emperor Zhuanxu feared the demon Chiyou would once again ravage the mortal realm. Limited by his own capabilities, he sought the help of the Queen of Huaxu, who once assisted Xuanyuan the Yellow Emperor in warding off the Otherworld with the Bell of Donghuang. Both Fuxi and Nuwathe children of the Queen of Huaxualso supported Emperor Zhuanxu in convincing the Queen, for they too could not bear to watch people suffer any longer. In the end, the gates to heaven were finally sealed with the powers of the Divine Artifacts combined.Since then, no mortals were able to ascend, nor were gods able to descend at will.

Your Toy,Xbox One,Viva Games,"['Adventure', '3D', 'First-Person']",T,2017-11-17,"Your Toy classes itself as a horror game but I wouldn’t call it that, instead I would call it more of a puzzle game with a creepy atmosphere that goes along with it. It’s not a bad game but it’s not a memorable game either, I will say though that it can provide you with some enjoyable moments from time to time. The game’s puzzles are very cleverly designed and you get a great sense of fulfilment when completing certain puzzles. You will though get stuck quite a lot and this did frustrate me from time to time, so if you don’t like puzzles that take a while to figure out then it’s probably best to give this game a miss. The bathroom scene in my opinion is the best thing about the game, and I wish the game would have stayed like this throughout. Unfortunately it doesn’t and in the end the game ends up dragging, which is a shame. Whilst this game may not have a lot of horror scenes going for it, it does have a few scares every now and then which keeps you on your toes. The boss battles though are not scary at all and I must admit that I was expecting a lot more here because everything about the boss battles is completely forgettable, and the worst thing is that there is no challenge at all. The presentation side of the game is something I really liked, especially when it came to the sound design. Visually the game is pretty basic, but the sound design is fantastic and it really makes the game deliver an immersive and creepy atmosphere. At the end of the day not everybody is going to like Your Toy, and those people that are sitting on the fence will be probably put off by the price of the game which is understandable because there isn’t enough content to justify its price tag. I will say though that the game isn’t bad and it does provide you with some unique puzzles in unique settings from time to time. As it stands now it doesn’t get a full recommendation from me because of the price, but when it goes down in price it may be worth a purchase.",55,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist,Xbox One,Konami,"['Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Card Battle']",E10+,2015-07-30,"Growing up, I played the original Yu-Gi-Oh! card game with just about anyone I could find. My brothers, my friends, and even my dad (who didn't have any idea what he was doing). I always admired the mechanics of Yu-Gi-Oh as a card game, but since time has moved on and it's become less socially acceptable to play Yu-Gi-Oh now that I'm a grown-ass man, I figured it would be nice if I could satisfy that occasional pang of Yu-Gi-Oh nostalgia by playing this game. Legacy of the Duelist is probably the most satisfying Yu-Gi-Oh video game I've ever played. I played the GBA games back when those were big, and this game is much more detailed (and has over 6,000 cards to collect). You also get to relive the duels of all five generations of the Yu-Gi-Oh TV series (Duel Monsters, GX, 5D's, Zexal, and a little bit of Arc-V). But I don't really care about any of those except for the original Duel Monsters series, since that was the one I grew up with. It covers a decent amount of that show, but not as much as I had hoped (the Noah arc isn't there at all, and I think there's a bunch of other stuff missing too). That said, most of the battles you care about are there from the beginning of the show up through the Battle City season. You can either use the story deck or your own custom deck for each duel, and you can even play as the opposing side if you want (giving you a chance to use Pegasus' deck against Yugi, rather than the other way around). You also win all sorts of trinkets for completing individual duels, including signature cards, and a sizable amount of DP (duelist points) you can use to buy different packs. You can also make up to 10 customizable decks with the cards you get, which is pretty handy. Yes, the game features online duels too, but I haven't gotten the chance to try those out yet (I'm afraid I'll get stomped since I haven't been playing long). But based on how in-depth the rest of the game is, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work. I'll update this review if there are any glaring problems with the online. The majority of the issues I have with the game are less about the features in the game and more about the game's presentation. What little character models there are are extremely underwhelming - seeing an ugly PS2-era Blue-Eyes White Dragon materialize out of your card leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately very few of these cards have these ugly animations. Most of the time it plays like you're playing the card game, with few interruptions. Also, there are no clips from the anime to bridge the duels you complete, and you get no chance to explore the world. All you get is a list of duels to beat in chronological order, and some text-based retelling of the context behind it. Considering the fact that past games have let you explore the world, and the fact that the world Yu-Gi-Oh takes place in is actually a fairly interesting one, this is a missed opportunity. On top of the other presentation-related complaints, the background of the playing arena rarely changes, and neither does the boring loop of music, making most duels feel same-y and of little consequence. I just switch on the Pandora app on Xbox One when I tire of the in-game music. Overall though, if you're looking for a way to play the straight Yu-Gi-Oh card game, build custom decks, play competitively with people online, and relive the anime (or maybe discover it for the first time), this is a surprisingly good package for the seemingly hefty $20 price tag. Hey, it's either find some friends who aren't embarrassed to play Yu-Gi-Oh and shell out on expensive packs and decks for the real thing, or shell out the $20 for this game. Personally, I'm all for the latter. :)",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,14.0,5.0,2.0,79.0

It's a bit more forgiving than Just Dance 2014, so when you hear the music and see the dance patterns it usually gives credit where credit is due, unless you aren't moving of course. If you're looking for household names and pop stars, then look away; this set-list is attune to just the music going to the moves, as well as Zumba original music. That said it's all very fun, there's a solid variety to the songs, and once you find some that you like, you're pretty hooked. Zumba has some incredibly frustrating kinect controls, it was a huge mistake not to implement use of the controller to navigate menus. Also with multiple players, the kinect has a difficult time linking a gamertag to the person, and when you want to sign in to continue your workout progress it becomes very tedious. My only other complaint is that I wish the setlist were a little bit more than 44 songs, but at the same time that's hardly anything to rag on, considering the replay-ability on most of the songs.  If you're looking for a game to dance to and maybe get something out of it, Zumba hits the right notes, it'll make you sweat after a few songs, the music is fun, and it really moves every part of your body.

ACA NeoGeo: Blue's Journey,Switch,ADK,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E,2017-09-07,"This is a sort-of-interesting Mario clone. All platform games are ""Mario clones"", to some extent. But, this is the closest I've ever seen a game come to replicating various aspects of the side-scrolling turtle-throwing Italian-plumber series. At the end of each level, you jump for a vine with different colored bells on it. Depending on how high you land, you receive some bonus points... Instead of jumping on turtle shells and throwing them, you jump on an assortment of enemies and throw them... Rather than growing when you eat a mushroom and shrinking when you get hit, you grow (temporarily) when you eat what looks like an ice cream cone and you can shrink yourself at will... The game looks ugly, despite well designed enemy sprites and colorful backgrounds. It looks like it was very carefully designed by someone with no artistic talent whatsoever... and it's not easy on the ears either... The music is annoying and the sound effects even more so. I'm giving it a 2, because there are some positive elements. Blue's Journey has weirdly complicated gameplay, that is mostly the result of unusual design. You can flip enemies over with a giant leaf and stack them on your head, one on top of the other, creating a huge projectile that can be fired across the screen. Or, you can do it Mario-style and jump on them, then kick them along the ground... Potentially, this is a good idea. But, like many other ideas in the game, it doesn't really work. Being able to shrink yourself at will sounds like a good idea, too, but it seems like there's not much reason for it... other than being able to fit through a couple of small gaps to gather collectibles. It's a pretty difficult game - especially for a cutesy platformer - but it's bad-difficult. Blue's Journey came out after Super Mario World, but it's not nearly as polished as the first Super Mario Bros game. It has the potential to be a decent retro platform romp, but it isn't...

ACA NeoGeo: Magician Lord,Switch,Hamster,"['Action Adventure', 'General']",E,2017-08-17,"If you're looking for a brutally difficult retro game, then this might be for you. Otherwise, it is unlikely to impress. Most of the enemies in the first two levels are badly designed. The only one I found remotely difficult to defeat was some sort of flying creature that bobs up and down while shooting fireballs at you. If you try to skip past these things and climb down a ladder, they will continue to fire at you through walls / platforms from off-screen. They appear, somewhat randomly, throughout the first two levels. The rest of the enemies (in the first level) either walk straight into your attacks or are incapable of hurting you when you're crouching down. So, all you have to do is duck and tap the shoot button. The sub-boss in the first level is absurdly easy, once you work out how to kill it. To take no damage, all you have to do is stand still and jump occasionally. The actual boss, again, is easy enough to kill once you work out how. All you have to do is stand in the right position and jump projectiles. But, spikes fall randomly from the ceiling while you're fighting it. So, depending on luck, it can be borderline impossible to not get hit. Magician Lord gets brutally difficult by the end of the second level / beginning of the third level, but not in a good way. There are a lot of frustrating moments where you get hurt due to poor game design. This, incidentally, is my biggest gripe with retro games. People who are addicted to ""member berries"" will tell you that retro games are better because modern games are too easy... If you have a look at what are presumably the best of the best Neo Geo titles they released for Nintendo Switch, this - obviously - isn't true... Games were more difficult back in the day. Sure. But, they were often difficult because of random events that were impossible to avoid unless you knew how to exploit them. The difficulty, back in the old days, often revolved around trial and error more than skill / reaction time. There are lots of exceptions to this, don't get me wrong. But, Magician Lord isn't exactly one of them. It's an arcade game ported to the Neo Geo and, like most arcade games, it's designed to be so difficult that you die repeatedly and end up pumping coins into it. There is an unbeatable enemy -the Death Bringer - that appears after you've been alive for too long. There is no way to avoid it. The Death Bringer will appear at least four times by the end of the game, and you only have three lives. So, it was obviously designed to ensure that - no matter how skilled you are - you eventually put another coin in... Based on the current top scores, nobody has gotten near the halfway mark on a single credit... Unlike some other Neo Geo arcade games available on the Switch, it's not possible to beat this game without using (at least) a couple of continues. The ability to transform into different forms is good, I guess, but they aren't significantly different and some of them are weaker than the normal magician form... The dragon man breathes fire, but only at close range. The electric man also only has a close range attack. The water man throws semi-short range weapons that are useless against some enemies. So, yeah, some of the transformations aren't very well designed. Sometimes, it's best not to pick up orbs. The controls are less sluggish than Sengoku (the other Neo Geo beat em 'up on Switch), but they're not even remotely up to modern standards. You walk really slowly. There's no run button. Jumping is stiff. Shooting is pretty responsive, but you can only fire a couple of projectiles - on screen - at one time. There are two buttons in Magician Lord. The attack button and the jump button. It's a VERY simple, frustrating, seriously-flawed game from the year 1990. It is nostalgic for me, because I used to play these games back then... But, even with the nostalgic factor, it's not great. I don't regret buying this. It's not a particularly satisfying game to play, for a number of reasons, but it probably gives me more of a nostalgic hit than any Neo Geo title so far. Most people won't like it... especially people born after 1990. But, if you're old like me, and you want to revisit those moments from your childhood when unforgiving arcade machines gobbled up your allowance... you might get something out of it. I'm almost certainly biased... not just because it's nostalgic for me, but - also - because (as of writing this) I'm ranked in the top 5 high scores for both Caravan Mode and High Score Mode. It feels good to get into the top 5 on any of these Neo Geo games...

Arcade Archives: Kid Niki Radical Ninja,Switch,Irem,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E10+,2018-01-25,"As a kid, I LOVED Kid Niki Radical Ninja.  It had a great sense of humor, too, and the title was an indicator that it wouldn't be your typical sidescroller.  It said ""Atta Boy!"" at the end of a level.  Kid Me thought that was brilliant.  Colorful graphics, satisfying arcade action (you hit a villain and they soar off screen), quirky villains, catchy if not repetitive music.  I give it a 5 because the release is not Kid Niki Radical Ninja.  The title, like the rest of what they chose to upload for a North American audience, is all in Japanese.  There are some poorly translated subtitles.  ""Atta Boy!"" has been replaced with ""Aha, you did that very well.""  It hurts the game's charm for anyone who grew up playing a North American Kid Niki machine in North America.  Other ACA titles presented the option of picking the US or JAP release (Metal Slug did this).  This North American title, at least on the Nintendo Switch, is a Japanese release.  Even the countdown bubble at the bottom of the screen displays Japanese characters instead of English numbers.  How's your Japanese number recognition?  Mine is poor.  I reached out to Hamster on their Customer Support page, sent an e-mail to their Customer Support e-mail account, and Tweeted them as well asking if this error would get a fix.  I did this the day of its release.  Over two weeks later and not a peep.  I contacted Nintendo as well, but their Customer Support interface didn't have 'Game was not as pictured and described on eShop' as a selectable help topic.  If you don't care about the game's humorous elements or moved here from Japan, you won't have a problem with this version of the game.  To someone who has been playing the US version for decades since its release, this is not Kid Niki Radical Ninja as the title suggests when you purchase it.  This is Kaiketsu Yanchamaru (快傑ヤンチャ丸) and should be advertised as such.  Aha.  They did not do that very well.",0,No score yet,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Caveman Warriors,Switch,JanduSoft,"['Action', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", '2D']",E10+,2017-12-05,"Entusiastas do gênero plataforma certamente dirão que há muito o que se ver em Caveman Warriors. Não consigo enumerar a quantidade de vezes em que fui ao fliperama jogar Joe & Mac, ou os famosos Caveman NINJAS, justamente por ser cativante tanto o seu formato grotesco quanto os inimigos principais que sempre me cativaram. Agora o Nintendo Switch ganha uma versão mais jovial de Joe & Mac, chegando à eShop via JanduSoft. Aqui, a narrativa vai um bocado além do que vimos no clássico dos fliperamas. Enquanto lá haviam dois personagens, aqui temos à nossa disposição cerca de 4 personagens cujos nomes são: Jack, Liliana, Moe e Brienne. Cada um com sua particularidade em seus ataques e estilos de estratégia para sobrevivência. Exemplo disto é uma das personagens que atira lanças que podem servir como plataforma para subirmos em locais mais altos, enquanto isso temos uma mulher totalmente musculosa onde seus danos são muito mais intenso. De posse desses 4 personagens, temos uma narrativa que se desenvolve através do rapto de seus filhos por um extraterrestre, então nossa missão é resgatá-los. O jogo começa com a escolha da personagem, mas podemos trocá-los através do L e R a qualquer momento. Isso fará com que o jogo se torne um pouco mais dinâmico e consequentemente menos marasmático. Durante a jogatina, os cenários pelos quais passamos são interessantes e no mínimo bonitos. A trilha sonora também é bem diversificada e deixa o jogo mais do que interessante, afinal a trilha sonora também tem de ser um ponto positivo para a imersão durante a experiência. O título permite até 4 jogadores multiplayer em modo cooperativo offline e isso me fez recordar imediatamente do jogo Vendetta, título do início dos anos 90 da Konami. Caveman Warriors possui um balanceamento interessante e a dificuldade não é tão plena, mas engana-se ao pensar que será simples passar por alguns cenários. Os mesmos possuem mínimos puzzles a serem resolvidos, coisa bem simples e os chefes de fase são complexos e exigem o mínimo de destreza. Esses puzzles por exemplo são determinadas partes do mapa que exigem a habilidade de um certo personagem que sem ele jamais passaríamos de fase. Ativar a lança de Liliana por exemplo e como já citado permitirá que alcancemos locais mais altos, enquanto o macaco de Joe irá distrair os inimigos, inclusive os chefes de fase para conseguirmos o mínimo de sucesso. De qualquer modo, os inimigos à nossa frente não são grandes coisas. Facilmente morrem com um ataque ou outro enquanto os boss são um pé no saco, inclusive o primeiro. Certamente o que irá lhe frustrar são os controles. Não funcionam com exatidão principalmente quando a questão é a taxa de resposta. Parece que para executar uma ação qualquer leva quase que 0,5ms para que o jogo execute a função. Isso é frustrante simplesmente por termos morrido diversas vezes justamente por darmos de cara com um inimigo e não conseguir matá-lo de imediato como gostaríamos. O VEREDITO Caveman Warriors é um bom jogo e bastante simplista com uma temática arcaica. Não é o melhor jogo para Switch, mas certamente é uma linda homenagem para com Joe & Mac, que foi eternizado por ser simples e carismático à sua moda.",53,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,5.0,3.0,5.2,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,2.0,52.0
Celeste,Switch,Matt Makes Games Inc.,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E10+,2018-01-25,"I don't like being a reactionist, or overpraising something too soon, but Celeste is one of the best 2D platformers I've ever played. I'll break down my review into individual segments: Controls: 10/10Very tight, extremely simple controls. Move with Left control stick. Jump with B. Dash with Y. Climb walls with RT. End of tutorial. But the sheer amount of mileage these developers get out of such a simple base is staggering Gameplay: 10/10While the controls are deceptively simple, every single chapter introduces a few new mechanics that you will have to master in order to progress. Whether they be platforms that disintegrate underneath you, platforms that move in sync with your dashing, walls you can dash through that have a unique effect. gemstones that replenish your dash midair, bubbles that shoot you far off into certain directions, and the list goes on and on, each new mechanic requires you to use them with near perfect precision and timing. The challenge can be occasionally frustrating, and you may find yourself dying several hundred times in any given chapter (I'm not exaggerating, you will die a lot), but it's the good kind of frustration that invites you to persist, not the kind that will cause you to rage quit. And none of your deaths feel out of your control. It doesn't require you to memorize every obstacle coming next, because there's never anything popping up that you didn't expect. Every obstacle is laid out in front of you, clear for you to see, which makes the challenge more inviting than frustrating.But I don't want to scare off potential players who are not so keen on the sound of timing and precision based gameplay, since that doesn't sound particularly fun by description alone, but this is a joy to play and an innumerable amount of sequences had me smiling and feeling accomplished by their end. Difficulty Level: 7/10I know 7 seems fairly low considering how much time I've already spent re-emphasizing the demand for precision, and how often you're going to die, and I'm sure you've already seen many other reviews that describe it to be tough as nails, and it is, but (thankfully) the game doesn't punish you for dying over and over and over and over. I had more than 300 deaths in a single chapter once. But this game doesn't kick you in the balls the way Cuphead does every time you die, you always re-spawn in the same frame that you died in, and it takes roughly half a second to re-spawn. The sheer amount of precision the game demands in and of itself would be enough to make it a 10, but the forgiving nature of the game makes the challenge much more manageable, so you can throw yourself at the same obstacle over and over and over and over again until you get it right, which is a godsend, because I would have honestly never bothered finishing the game if I had to deal with a lives system, or if it sent me back to the beginning of each level, or something like that. Story: 7/10I'm actually not as enamored with the story as many other people seem to be. I think it's great to see more and more video games experiment in dealing with heavy thematic matter such as anxiety, panic, apathy, depression, emotional distance, etc, and I think Celeste does a good job of it, and I can imagine many people out there being touched by it, because it handles delicate topics with sensitivity, earnestness, and a touch of humor. I like the characters a lot (and I love that they actually created an Instagram account for the character who is always taking selfies and writing posts throughout the game), but I don't think it's quite perfect yet. I really hope the developers keep experimenting with this kind of subject matter, because Celeste has made me eager for whatever the dish up next. Artwork/Design: 8/10I used to refer to this segment as ""graphics,"" because graphical power used to be important when reviewing games, but we've reached an era of gaming when gamers and reviewers are less concerned about graphical horsepower and more interested in artwork, with absolutely beautiful looking games such as Cuphead and Journey, which are both stunning games due to their artwork, even though they're not going to max out the system you run them on by any means. Celeste is in that category, and it is a brilliantly designed game. Music: 9/10It is impressive in and of itself that these indie developers composed more than two hours of music for a relatively short game (around 10hrs max to complete all of the main bits, 20 if you're a completionist that is going to collect all the strawberries and complete all the ""B side"" challenges), and it pays off, because the soundtrack is just beautiful. Overall: 10/10While I think the story is good, even though I wasn't as deeply impressed with it as many other reviewers were, the controls, gameplay, and design are every bit as good as you've heard and Celeste is a game that deserves to be experienced by anybody who can spare twenty bucks to try it out.",93,Universal acclaim,25.0,0.0,0.0,8.1,Generally favorable reviews,130.0,5.0,26.0,81.0

But you also HAVE to, because by default, they almost never show the board sufficiently (for my taste).The controls are not adjustable, that means you have to tip the control stick or the button EVERY time you want to move the cursor. It gets annoying if you want to cross the whole board.At the moment, there is no dlc available, but it looks like there will be in the future (option available in menue). However i would prefer to see more configuration options, rather than more design choices for the pieces and the board. I always use the standard board an pieces, because I sometimes have a hard time figuring out which piece is what, and that annoys me a lot.So, some more options, some dlc, and Chess Ultra could make it to a 8....",79,Generally favorable reviews,5.0,3.0,0.0,7.5,Generally favorable reviews,7.0,1.0,2.0,75.0

Crawl,Switch,Powerhoof,"['Role-Playing', 'General']",T,2017-12-19,"Crawl for Nintendo Switch may be the single most fun I have ever had in a video game to date. The main drawback (for me) is the retro stylings of the environment, sprites and general gameplay. I am not a fan of the pixelated retro style in any game and Crawl is no exception, I do not feel it adds anything to the aesthetics or the environment of the game to have it in a retro style and would have much preferred to see it in the finesse style of games like Diablo 3. That being said, even the retro styling is still not enough to dissuade me from giving Crawl a solid 10/10. With three friends or family members Crawl can provide seemingly endless fun. If you are looking for a four player couch-play game for you and your friends/family look no further. The narration is a touch of brilliance, topped only by the ideas behind the game. With a torrent of uniquely different monsters at your command, all with different upgrade paths and randomised spawns each encounter feels vastly different too the last. Furthermore, the addition of the randomised shop for the hero ensures that not two games ever play out the same. If you are a fan of single player games for the switch I would not recommend picking up crawl, there are better purely single player games out there at the moment (Zelda, Mario etc.). Single player is not where this game shines. The unimaginably good multiplayer has catapulted this game to my new #1 favourite game. I cannot recommend this game enough if you have three friends or family members that you can consistently play with. The main thing the game is lacking is supported online multiplayer. With online multiplayer the drawbacks of not having three local players would be negated, further more the single player mode lacking the compelling enjoyment of the multiplayer would also be redundant with the ability to play online matches. Very excited for any future updates to the game!",82,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,0.0,0.0,7.7,Generally favorable reviews,8.0,0.0,2.0,77.0

Balance is also better. Some boss is easier bit still challenging enough. The game is much more fun now. It' good to know that the dev listened to all criticisms. (I give 9.5 score) Earth Atlantis Review - Visual is amazing !! Gameplay concept is interesting. If you love retro space shooters  (R-type, Blood Money, In the hunt, Gradius, steel Empire), buy this game. Graphics - Obviously, the visual is very unique and also very beautiful. It use monochrome pencil-drawing style. When I saw only screenshots, I though it must be very eye-soaring to play this game, but NO, It looks great. I also like the parallax FX on the background. For some reason, It looks even better On handheld mode. Concept - I really love ""Monster-Hunting"" concept. Also, the game has only one large level ""Metroidvania"" style. I think it's s great combination. You have 38 monsters to hunt. In Quest mode, you have to kill some boss to open new locations/areas. Bosses are very different - some are swimming type/ some standing type. Gameplay - This one is tricky. This game is quite challenging . It's definitely just like old retro shooter game on NES/Genesis - people might consider them hard. Some boss are difficult but challenging. You need to carefully learn each boss attacking pattern. You can die easily even on easy setting if you are not careful enough, some boss has one hit-kill attack that might be difficult to some casual player and when you die, you need to upgrade your ship again from O, again just like old games. I will frustrate some casual gamers. It's not ""Dark-Soul"" difficult though. The game have a decent pace. Not as fast as, I thought.  But it will get faster when you use new ships, they are faster than a default one. (I have unlocked 2 more ships so far.) Performance - the game run very well. I have never found any frame-rate drop problem. No glitch found. I've played this game for more than 6 hours (~50% completed) - I really enjoyed it. Conclusion: If you are a retro space-shooter fan (Genesis/NES) - buy this game.

Energy Invasion,Switch,Sometimes You,"['Action', 'Arcade']",E,2018-01-11,"Energy Invasion despite the exciting artwork in the Switch eShop, is an arcadey de-evolution of Brick Breaker with a twist.  The main ball that you are focused on does not break bricks, however with your right joystick you shoot missiles either up, down, left or right similar to a twin stick shooter.  Whenever you shoot one of these micro projectiles the main ball jumps just a bit, showing the lack of polish in a game with a minimal amount of mechanics. The organic nature of the game artwork throws you for quite a loop when trying to accurately bounce and hit the ball as it comes toward the bottom of the screen.  As the paddle you move to hit the ball is a mess of celestial spaghetti, it makes it difficult to get those tough corner shots these sort of games are known for. The opposition in the game is a little corner enemy that shoots red lasers bouncing around the screen.  They’ll end your turn if they hit your paddle and change the route of the main ball.  For a game that already feels unintuitive this addition doesn’t do much to challenge the player, instead it’s unpredictability just leaves you with frustration. The main mechanics of the game don’t feel right while you're playing.  As you want to hit the ball at the perfect moment to smash that last brick, in Energy Invasion you just sort of bounce the ball around shooting unresponsive projectiles around the map.  Bouncing them back up to create a sort of danger zone for any remaining bricks. While the gameplay is quite lackluster the visuals while repetitive are very nice, combined with the intriguing music would be a fantastic music would be a fantastic screensaver. Verdict Energy Invasion is an arcadey throwback, thrown way to short.

Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star,Switch,Marvelous Inc.,"['Action', ""Beat-'Em-Up"", '3D']",T,2017-07-25,"Never played a Type-Moon game before, so this was my first introduction to the Fate series. I seriously don't see how anyone couldn't follow the plot or that it was hard to understand what was going on because they weren't a fan of the series... sure it makes reference to past games, and I think maybe the anime, and the characters are mostly past entries in this series, but the plot of this game is not really a continuation, it's just based in the Fate universe with it taking place after Fate/Extra. You can play this as a standalone game and enjoy what it has to offer. I adored the characters, and I thought the plot in terms of the relationship dynamics was executed wonderfully.The gameplay itself is inspired by the Musou series of games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Warriors Orochi), and it does a great job of adding enough original ideas mixed with that style to feel like it's own thing. There could be some improvements, and hopefully, the sequel will fix that, but as hack and slash, 1 vs 1000 game, it does it's job well, and me being a Musou game fan, I loved it. It also doubles as a visual novel/dating type of game too, as you bond with the characters you play as. I like this idea over the Koei Tecmo games because it adds a more human element to the characters you control, I care for the character I play as because I've befriended them and bonded with them through my interactions with them. I just wish there was more than the three charcaters that you could have this interaction with, because I would love to have that same level of interaction with a character like Artoria Pendragon or Elizabeth Bathory, something which again I hope they improve in the sequel. Other than that. Great game. If you like Dynasty Warriors and the various spin-offs (Like Hyrule Warriors and/or Fire Emblem Warriors) you'll probably love this, and with the added visual novel feel with the ""dating"" elements it's probably gonna appeal to the ""waifu/husbando"" lovers out there. And this game is certainly well suited on the Nintendo Switch with the fact that you can take this anywhere and enjoy hack and slash action on the go and on a big TV.

Floor Kids,Switch,Merj Media,"['Action', 'Rhythm', 'Dancing']",E,2017-12-07,"As far as rhythm games go, this on is up there. Beautiful artwork that fit perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. You can easily tell that the people who made this are genuinely passionate about street-dance and music in general. The almost-philosophical cutscenes can be boring and unnecessary to some, but for me it was yet another proof that a lot of passion was put into this game. As for content,  there is much more than meets the eye, a lot of characters with so much different combos. It is challenging but not too hard to master a certain character. though I honestly thought that the game throws you a bit too fast into the action without teaching you enough things, but some people love that. Overall, the overwhelming amount of moves combination made me scared to go try other characters and i ended up mastering only one of them and playing the entire game with that same character (O-Live). So, negatives: Below average storyline (eventhough that’s obviously not what they were going for), Too many moves and combos to be able to learn them all and too little tutorials (personal opinion). Positives: Great gameplay (especially for a rhythm game), flat-out fun to play, 2 player mode is awesome, amazing artwork, and most of all ; an enormous amount of passion was obviously put into the making of this game. For anyone who like rhythm games or even music in general, this game is for you and the small team who made this gem deserve your interest.",77,Generally favorable reviews,9.0,3.0,0.0,7.2,Mixed or average reviews,7.0,3.0,1.0,72.0

Green Game: Timeswapper,Switch,iFun4all,"['Puzzle', 'Action']",E,2017-11-17,"The player guides a character through levels, but cannot interact with the character directly. The character will always move in a straight line until they run into a direction changing obstacle. The only way that players can interact with anything at all is by swiping left and right on the touch screen, which moves a bar of green light across the screen. When the bar of light is moved, it toggles every single changeable object in the level at once. The end result is that the player feels like they're pushing and pulling the same lever non-stop in order to play. This is the ""timeswapper"" mechanic. As far as I can tell, it is the only control. Occasionally the lever will need to be carefully positioned in the middle of the screen in order to force the bird to move at an angle. This gets particularly frustrating as you may only have a second or two to wrestle with swiping exactly 27, 42, or 83% of the way across the screen to get the stupid bird to move at a punishingly precise angle or else run into a wall and die. Repeatedly. Although the collectibles in each level (a series of 3 star tokens) might have been used to give the player a mental gymnastic exercise, in practice they only encourage the player to struggle against the game's overly simplistic and poorly implemented user interface. Due to the fact that there's literally only one thing the player can do to control anything (swipe), there is no ability or incentive to explore. Also due to the fact that there's literally one control, the game highlights the most mundane parts of video gaming. It actively draws attention or of the level and makes you focus on the fact that you're repeating the same gesture ad nauseam.  The levels become more technically difficult, but provide no diversity of experiences. The one redeeming factor is the fifteen second animation at the beginning of the game. Downhill from there. Sure, it's only the price of a hot dog, but I've played better games on my cell phone for free. More than the price, it's just not worth the time. So go but a hot dog.

Gunbarich,Switch,Zerodiv,"['Action', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Vertical']",E,2017-08-03,"Dancing bears, laser gorillas, and pinball battle?! Well get ready for arcade chaos! Gunbarich is a Japanese arcade game originally released in 2001 by Saikyō.  A nice combination between brickbreaker and classic pinball, with some boss battles sprinkled on top. You control the paddle’s left to right movement working to get your timing just right to hit your pinball...giving it a little extra zing which deals more damage to bricks and enemies.  The goal being to break all of the bricks within a certain amount of time. If your pinball gets past you,  you die and if you run out of time you die.  Dying from running out of time while only having one block left in a level is super frustrating, but made me smile everytime, enjoying that old school “we don’t care try again” mentality.  The rounds move fast so if you die in world 4, it doesn’t take you long to get back to where you were, so the emotional investment in each round is minimal.  Also ending each round with that old school arcade scoreboard rings that good ole nostalgia bell is a great way. The fun of Gunbarich comes with the increasing difficulty and variation in level design.  Eventually the pre-world instructions are simply “becareful there will be increasing difficulty…”Which peaked my interest and did not fail to deliver, like when i ran into these enemies and swallow you pinball then spit it out in one of its three other locations randomly.  This truly surprised me upon first encounter and became one of my favorite enemies.  Making me scour the screen for my pinball...the moment it burst out. Like many other Nintendo Switch ports you have the option to toggle between the retro graphic style and the more crisp remastered version, RETRO PLEASE!  I love this recurring feature in modern day remakes. Speaking of graphics, they’re crazy.  Dancing bears, sweet anime illustrations, I love the look of this game.  Vintage japanese oh yes please. Gunbarich is a nostalgic pinball playground, that while challening, has the variation to break up the monotany and keep you coming back.  This game will continue to freshen up my morning commute for many pinball battles to come. Check out my video review on YouTube channel TheFlannelFox",66,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Levels+ : Addictive Puzzle Game,Switch,flow,"['Puzzle', 'Logic']",E,2017-07-13,"When I saw Levels+ on the Nintendo Switch eShop, I wasn't sure if it was a game or not. It has one of the worst titles ever... I suspect something was lost in translation when they came up with the English version, but I'm not sure what a better title would be. The game is so simple, it's hard to label (and it's difficult to review). Levels+ has the shortest learning curve I've ever seen. The mechanics are ultra-simple. It takes less than one minute to learn everything you need to know about how to play the game. Though, I'm not sure if ""game"" is the right word... There is only one puzzle in Levels+. There are no game modes, and there is no option to play online. So, is it a puzzle game or just a puzzle? Pedantry aside, whatever it is, I absolutely love it (and so does my girlfriend). If it had a good multi-player option, I'd give it a perfect score. The game board is made up of twenty-five colorful, numbered, tiles. Blue tiles are the good guys.Red tiles are the baddies.Yellow tiles are treasure. The idea is to kill the baddies and collect as much treasure as possible. But, in order to do so, the good guys need to have equal or higher values than their adjacent tiles. If your blue tile is a two, you can move it into a red/yellow two (or one)... Also blue (or yellow) tiles of the same number can be joined together to form a new tile. The level goes up every time you do this. In other words: if you join a blue one and a blue one, you get a blue two. It is advertised as ""easy... but difficult... simple, but (deep)"" and this is a perfectly accurate description. The gameplay is surprisingly sophisticated, considering how simple it is. I love this game so much that I'm hesitant to give it a 9 (instead of a 10). If I could give it a 9.5, I would... I just don't understand why there is no online multiplayer option. It'd be so easy to code, I could do it myself. It's a shame. But, this is my only complaint. Levels+ is brilliantly designed. If you're a fan of puzzles, I highly recommend checking it out.",62,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,5.0,0.0,6.9,Mixed or average reviews,6.0,0.0,2.0,69.0

Maria The Witch,Switch,Naps Team,"['Action Adventure', 'Linear']",E,2017-11-09,"Jogos para Nintendo Switch a cada dia que passa estão ficando melhores. Depois de anunciarem que Bayonetta 3 chegaria ao console, tivemos outros bons títulos sendo anunciados - e consequentemente, lançados para o console. Maria de Witch é um joguinho simples, que está longe de títulos grandes e foi lançado para o videogame da Nintendo somente na versão digital - e que também está presente no console da Microsoft. É nessa hora que sabemos se um jogo é grande o suficiente para emplacar algo na vida do console. Boa parte dos jogos lançados para aparelhos móveis seja androids ou IOS, acabam chegando nos consoles. Quando isso acontece, significa que o mesmo teve um certo sucesso nos dispositivos móveis. Maria The Witch não introduz uma trama complexa, sequer pomposa e apenas sabemos que assim como Sonic, temos que colecionar certos itens na tela. As moedas por exemplo, irão ajudar sua personagem a comprar o local do checkpoint e assim, consequentemente, poderá salvar sua progressão. Mas e se os comandos não permitirem tamanha façanha? Os comandos são MUITO confusos e para controlar a bruxinha em sua vassoura chega a ser um suplício sem precedentes. Talvez a pior parte do título esteja justamente nos comandos que apesar de simples (A para voar para a direita e Y para a esquerda), a complicação está em justamente a quantidade de vezes que é necessário manter pressionados os botões para ela fazer uma espécie de inclinação suficiente para pegarmos algo em um beco nas nuvens. E para piorar, não podemos encostar em absolutamente nada, salvo para uma área onde Maria utiliza desta área aparentemente 'asfaltada' para salvar o checkpoint. Ao errar o comando se desejaria apenas manter ela em uma reta linear ou se desejaria efetuar um mortal/loop, voltará a todo momento do checkpoint ou do início da fase e sempre terá uma lembrança aqui e ali dos controles. É uma quantidade infindável de tentativas para no mínimo conseguir algo no jogo. Talvez a missão de Maria não fosse tão complexa de  justamente chegar no final do mapa e coletar os itens (cartas e utensílios) no caminho sem encostar em nada, se não fosse pelos comandos atrapalhados que necessitam de uma certa destreza. Maria é uma bruxa, mas também é ''funcionária do correio'' e precisa entregar essas correspondências que vamos coletando no caminho. As mecânicas do jogo não fluem bem deixando a jogabilidade como a pior coisa já experimentada pela nossa equipe até o momento. Não é só ruim não, é muito ruim mesmo a experiência de controlá-la. Se temos uma jogabilidade praticamente um belo fiasco, em termos de visual, o jogo é apresentável. Temos cores vivinhas, uma bruxa que no mínimo é carismática, mas até então é só isso. Alias, a trilha sonora também é outro pontinho positivo. Maria The Witch tenta ser diferente, mas é essa diferença toda que acabou ferrando com o jogo. É sim um jogo feito para dispositivos móveis e lá deveria de ficar, visto que dificilmente jogos de console migram para mobile, justamente por que cada um deve estar no seu quadrado e não se meter. Infelizmente o jogo é bem frustrante em todos os quesitos, salvo pelos gráficos e a trilha sonora que salvam o jogo de um desastre ainda maior. Maria The Witch foi analisado pela equipe do Blah Cultural no console Nintendo Switch.

Mom Hid My Game!,Switch,Hap,"['Adventure', 'Point-and-Click']",E,2017-12-21,"Mom Hid My Game! is actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I have to admit I did buy the game so I can make a joke of the title (but the original iOS title is really the joke-worthy title) and because it was one of the few games I wanted from the Nintendo Indie presentation back in August. But the game was actually very creative. I got a laugh about how extreme the boy's mom was about hiding the game, like by Day 4 she hides it in a crocodiles mouth. I do have one complainant, Day 9 is broken on the Switch version, because it is missing a fly in the window that is needed to knock over the obstacles in front of the closet... but they end up toppling over on themselves somehow without it. I only know this because I downloaded 'Hidden my game by Mom' (which was very poorly translated by the way) just to see what levels they included in the switch version and if it was just a port of the app (which it wasn't, it was collections of levels from that app and 'Hidden my game by Mom 2'). The ending of the game was actually kind of deep and hit an emotional chord with me, I was very surprised that they could get some sort of story element in this game. And after you beat all 50 days you do get some post game content, its kind of fun and every time you complete it you get a new end animation for the post game content and there was a lot of work out into that and its probably going to be overlooked by a lot of people.

This sort of reminds me of Froza where you can make the game sim or not. When it comes to graphics it definitely gets the job done, it looks decent in third person but the game really shines when you play the game in first person view. You can really get a feel for your bike and have great control over it, the controls allowing you to control your rider and the bike quite accurately which can make playing the game feel natural. As for the single player there is a lot of ways for you to enjoy it and the career is pretty deep for a racing game.

Snow Moto Racing Freedom,Switch,Zordix AB,"['Racing', 'Arcade', 'Other']",,2017-11-24,Developer Zordix has released their game Snow Moto Racing Freedom on Switch and it's a blast to play. The core of the game consists of snowmobile races in two different fashions. One where you are racing from checkpoint to checkpoint in an open (huge) world. The other mode lets you race on a carefully placed racetrack with tight turns and jumps. This is called Snocross and this race-form exists in real life as well. As is common in racing games you have a championship mode and a single race mode. In the championship mode you start out like usual with two weak snowmobiles and easy opponents. By getting good placements you advance to higher leagues and more snowmobiles. There is also both local splitscreen and online multiplayer for the players wanting some pvp races. If you feel inclined you also have a leisure mode where you can explore any of the game's gigantic 3 open world maps set in different locations around the world. This is definitely the best snowmobile racing game out today!,52,Mixed or average reviews,0.0,3.0,1.0,7.9,Generally favorable reviews,6.0,0.0,2.0,79.0

Space Dave!,Switch,Choice Provisions,"['Action', 'General', 'Shooter', ""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Vertical']",E,2018-01-25,"Space Dave! The spiritual successor to Woah Dave! Is a fixed arcade shooter by the developers that brought you Bit Trip, Space dave has blasted it’s way onto the Nintendo Switch Space Dave is a fixed shooter but with a modern twist, like the classics you can only move left and right and shoot upward, but you can jump.  Which comes in handy because your enemies can smash the ground beneath you, leaving behind lava, and just like playing in your living room as a little kid, if you step on the lava, YOU DIE!  After enemies destroy the ground, they turn red and when killed, they drop magma.  Picking up this magma and throwing it at the lava will turn it back to solid ground. Space Dave has three difficulties Easy peasy, Normal, and bonkers.  None of these modes should be entered lightly as Space Dave is tough as nails.  However, the pick-ups throughout the game do alot to level the playing field.  Extra drones and spread shot give you an extra little boost, but grabbing the space pick up allows you to launch it toward enemies and recruit them to your side.  Very quickly changing the tides of space battle, alas when hit by either and enemy of the vividly colored pills they drop at you you’ll lose one of your lives and with it all of your recently acquired perks.  Lose all three of your lives and you start the level over.  If you shoot down the flying saucer and collect the Dave coin, it saves a check point so you can restart from the there instead of the beginning of the level. When shooting in Space Dave you can either hold down the fire button or rapidly press it, when you rapidly press it you’ll fire a bit faster which while making it a little more worth the hassle, but becomes quite annoying over time and I wish you could just hold down the button for the same fire rate.  Even though the person next to you on the subway will look at you a little crazy while button mashing, it does remind me of pounding buttons years ago in an arcade. While the gameplay is nostalgically frustrating, a perfect reminder to the NES era of gaming.  The real pull of Space Dave are the sights and sounds.  Vivid pixelated graphics while used quite often in indie games, still delight me when they are done this well.   Monsters, spaceships, and environments beautifully executed keep me smiling while blasting enemies them out of the air. Space Dave is a brutal walk down memory lane, while it may not be for everyone, the retro arcade shooter fans will certainly enjoy this alien blasting adventure. With eight different characters to control, many multi-phase stages, and two player mode, Space Dave provides hours and hours of single player or co-op fun. Be sure to watch my video review on my YouTube Channel TheFlannelFox",72,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Stern Pinball Arcade,Switch,System 3,"['Action', 'Pinball']",T,2017-12-12,"In my opinion, I think Stern is a far superior game to Pinball FX for one simple reason: the table designs are far superior.   Real pinball tables are made by master craftsmen who spend countless hours designing each table.  There can be no mistakes in it's creation.  You can't just rewrite software to fix errors and problems, everything has to be meticulous and perfect in it's design.   Because each stern table is a digital representation of real world tables, that element of master craftsmanship carries over; and it shows.  The feel of the table, the weight of the ball, the skill required to play, and the table objects are all so so so much better than pinball FX. Pinball FX is a solid game to be sure, but all you have to do is compare the table rules of a Pinball FX table to any Stern table to see the difference in design efforts.  Stern tables have many goals and objectives which makes mastering these tables a real challenge.  This also makes each stern table feel more valuable than FX tables as there is a lot more to explore and learn with each table. However, what I consider to be Stern's greatest asset, may be a detriment to others.  Stern will be more for the true pinball enthusiasts whereas casual players will gravitate more toward pinabll fx.    Stern pinball's interface is clunky and there are no bells or whistles.  All there is a blissful pure pinball experience that will be more difficult and more rewarding than anything Pinball FX has to offer.  However, For those that don't want to climb the difficult hill that is a real pinball table, then FX is the better way to go.  For me, there is no comparison.  I love real pinball and therefore Stern is the way to go.  Anything else feels like a lesser experience.",0,No score yet,0.0,2.0,1.0,6.2,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,1.0,2.0,62.0

In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought. Tachyon Project is a dual stick shooter where we've taken concepts from the classic shoot'em up genre and tried to adapt them to the dual stick shooter genre. In Tachyon Project the player will find the gameplay versatility and speed traditional to dual stick shooters but with the variability in weapons and enemies that you usually find in shoot'em ups. The variety of weapons, secondary weapons and perks allow for hundreds of combinations for your ship. That, along with the number of different enemy types provides a lot of gameplay variety that is something quite unique in the genre. Tachyon Project also brings new ideas to the table, presenting a new stealth mode in some levels where you have to pick carefully when to shoot to avoid being discovered too early and keep yourself disguised. The game provides an interesting story mode where you go unlocking new weapons, secondary weapons and perks as you progress and uncover the story behind Ada's creation. But you can also play on challenges that present you with unending hordes of enemies to try for the best score and compete in leaderboards. You can play these challenges either alone or with friends in up to 4 player local multiplayer co-operative games.",70,Mixed or average reviews,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,No user score yet,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The Mummy Demastered,Switch,WayForward,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",E10+,2017-10-24,"Everyone has a genre that is a sort of comfort food. Something that you can jump into no matter how bad or campy it may be – mine is JRPGs. Whether it’s a AAA title, or an indie game emulating what worked well in the 90s, I can always appreciate a JRPG to some extent. But there’s a “genre” that is defined by two series that I may love as much, if not more: metroidvanias. WayForward started making games back in the 90s, and before they had a chance to release their big IP Shantae, they would create licensed games. When you think of games based off of movies or television shows, your feelings are probably mediocre at best. And to be honest, those feelings would be valid for most games that were released. The difference is, WayForward puts their all into everything they create. I’m not say Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses was the best game of 2006, but it is likely the best Barbie game you can play. When I heard that the most recent Mummy movie was getting a game, I was cautiously optimistic based on the initial screens I saw. After I heard who was developing it, I knew there was no reason to fear. The Mummy Demastered is a classic metroidvania title in the style of WayForward. You have a map with waypoints of where to go, different colored rooms based on what they contain, and secrets galore, often hiding upgrades to health or weaponry. You’ll also gain new abilities as you progress, allowing you access to previously unreachable areas. The first is given very early on in the form of a grenade, which opens up boarded off rooms. After the first boss, you’re given the ability to climb along ceilings, stopping to shoot if need be. For each ability you gain, a new obstacle will keep you from progressing, meaning you’ll have to come back when you have the right artifact. Having never seen the recent movie, I can’t speak to how much of a crossover there is in content. I know that Princess Ahmanet is in both, but that’s about it. While I haven’t seen Tom Cruise battle one of the Universal monsters in their new expanded movie universe, I can tell you that it’s not needed for the enjoyment of this game. While some tie-in games like to reference the movie and make you go “oh yeah, we’re at this part,” this is fantastic without any context. For me, the characters could have been anyone else and it would’ve been just as good. The basic controls of the game involve moving, shooting in 8 directions, rolling, and jumping. As stated previously, you will gain new abilities as you progress, but these are what you’ll use most. Weapons have limited ammunition outside of your initial machine gun, although picking up ammo is as easy as killing an enemy or shooting a lantern or any other breakable objects. It wasn’t until the first boss that I even bothered to use my secondary weapon. It’s also here that you see the game’s way of telling you where a boss is with its life – they gradually turn red. For those of us that played a lot of games in the 90s, this will be familiar. You know how some developers you loved as a child have gone in directions you disagree with? WayForward is the developer that has stayed true to themselves after almost 30 years. If you took 90s Capcom or Konami and dropped them in present day, this is what they’d be making. If you’re familiar with Castlevania or Metroid, you should be right at home here. Enemies will throw their bones at you, projectiles will pass through the ground or the walls that would protect you otherwise, and the enemies are never-ending. Wall crawling foes will drop on you if they happen to see you below. Winged beasts will fly up and down in your general direction; shooting balls of plasma every chance they get, hoping to knock you off that platform you strove to reach only to fall in some acid (quite honestly, this is what upset me the most while playing – the knock back from damage did elicit several choice words throughout). Enemies will also flood the screen, and you’ll have to time your jumps and shoot with precision to avoid death. But don’t worry; there are plenty of save points around the map. And you can always farm health from enemies by leaving a room and coming back, or by using spawn areas for certain mobs. The game even has collectibles for you to find if you fancy yourself a completionist. Finding them all may or may not affect the endgame. This is very much the type of game that brought me into this field of entertainment. This is what a solid 90s game looks and feels like when made today. This is the type of the thing that WayForward is known for, and another reason you should care about what they develop and publish. The Mummy Demastered is the type of game you show someone that says they miss the “good ol’ days” of video games. If you dislike 2D shooters with upgrades, secrets, and bosses, stay away.

Unepic,Switch,unepic fran,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,2017-12-15,"Unepic is a 2d metroidvania rpg originally released in 2011, now dungeon crawling it’s way onto the Nintendo Switch.  Playing as Daniel, an average bear who when in the middle of a beer swaddled game of dungeons and dragons with his mates, decides to use the bathroom.  While in the middle of using the pot, someone turns out the lights, when they come back on Danny boy is no longer in his mediocre life, but in a cavernous dungeon filled with demons, weapons, and magic. Weapon of choiceAs a typical side scrolling platformer you can move, jump, use your weapon, and have an action button.  Which works for interacting with different parts of the environment and picking up loot.  Using weapons that you find around the dungeon for different enemies or environmental hurdles.  Swords are great for slicing through mutant grubs, maces smash barrels and stone projectiles, and using a bow is great for those lunging slithery snakes or hard to see bats.  As the game doesn’t pause while in the menu, like most games, navigating your way to your inventory to choose a new weapon can be quite the risky maneuver.  Fortunately, an amazing inventory quick select system, in which you can map any inventory item to a button combo, it’s easy to switch from dagger to wand to halo in a flash.  While it doesn’t make the game’s heads up display very nice to look it, it’s function certainly does the job. Oh Danny Boy!From Star Wars to Harry Potter, Unepic certainly drops in enough funny references to keep the average nerd laughing.  Really leaning into the fact that Daniel, the main character, knows tons about geek games and movies, that it breaks the fourth wall and allows you to relate with him even more.  While most video game stories are cliche and predictable, unepic realizes it is being cliche and really leans into it.At the beginning you are possessed by a faceless soul who continuously is wishing for your demise, so that he can be freed.  As a result he is always leading you to your death, so when reaching a fork in the road where you have to decide to trust someone or not; if you do the opposite of what he tells you, it’s pretty much a safe bet you made the right decision.Different than most metroidvanias you don’t learn new skills to open up new sections of the map.  Instead, you find keys which are a bit less rewarding as it robs you of that sense of discovery when you try a new skill in a new section of the map.  Remembering where the library and sewer are can save you a lot of time from wandering around when you find a new key.  Combat in Unepic is just that, unepic.  Mashing the attack button swings your axe, sword, or mace while holding also fires your bow. Unfortunately lacking a dodge roll or block, keeps the combat feeling a bit bland, when getting into the thick of battle. Unepic is a solid indie 2d metroidvania, with a great loot and progression system, but lacking in moment to moment gameplay and overall polish. With the amount of amazing metroidvania in the Nintendo Switch, unepic is not at the top of my list. Please watch my video review at YouTube channel TheFlannelFox",0,No score yet,0.0,3.0,0.0,7.1,Mixed or average reviews,3.0,3.0,1.0,71.0

Yodanji,Switch,Kemco,"['Role-Playing', 'Roguelike']",E10+,2017-12-07,"Yodanji is a rogue-like RPG made in the style and look of old PC games. The player starts out with three Yokai and must journey through a procedural dungeon in order to unlock more. The game is very challenging, making unlocking new Yokai feel accomplishing and getting a chance to try all of their diverse playstyles kept me engaged for more hours than expected from a $5 game. For new players deaths may seem unfair, but every enemy follows strict rules about their abilities and stats. The more one plays the more they learn to deal with abilities that earlier may have seemed cheap. Yodanji is full of Japanese folklore, each Yokai having their own backstory and concept art that are filled with the essence of ancient mythology. They feel like the kind of thing that would come in the manual of the game if it were made in the 90s. Cons:- There is very few musical tracks so the music gets repeative fast.- The controls can take some getting used to, a little clunky.- The game is $3 on mobile, the Switch version has a few extras but not a lot",54,Mixed or average reviews,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,No user score yet,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
