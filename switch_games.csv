But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends... IORI FUYUSAKAShe believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? EI SEKIGAHARA A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past.

Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... KEITARO MIURA A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul.

117,A Dark Room,Switch,Amirali Rajan,"['Adventure', 'Text']",E,"Apr 12, 2019","Having previously played the browser and iOS versions of A Dark Room, I immediately got it on the Switch, not knowing that it would be removed from the eShop just days later. A Dark Room is generally categorized as an ""incremental game"" due to having incrementally increasing counters for various resources. Unlike many other incremental games, like ""Cookie Clicker"", A Dark Room has a basic story, exploration, and a basic battle system. While the game is relatively short with a completion time of just a few hours, new gameplay mechanics are unlocked incrementally, giving the player a sense of progress and achievement. After finishing the game on the Switch, I did notice a few differences between the Switch version and the other versions, such as the inclusion of new story elements. The worst aspect of the game is how it is controlled. While the browser and iOS versions of A Dark Room were designed to be played with a mouse and touchscreen, respectively, the Switch version seems to attempt to compromise these two control methods, making both worse. I find the way that the controls are mapped to the controller to be very unintuitive, with several button presses having multiple buttons assigned to them, such as being able to move down in the menu with either left or down and moving up with right or up. While playing in tablet mode fixes the issue of the controller, I find that the on-screen buttons are a bit too small to be convenient for regular gameplay, making me reluctantly decide to use a controller. I also think that at its price point the game needs additional updates to its gameplay and UI to give the player more value than just playing the game's free browser counterpart. One interesting addition to the Switch version is very basic support for a second player, so making the game more multiplayer friendly would add value to the game as well. Aside from the issues with the controls, this version of A Dark Room is a good port of the previous versions, while still adding a few new story elements. If the game is put back onto the eShop, I hope that it is updated with better controls and more updates from the previous versions of A Dark Room.",0,No score yet,1,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,1,1,0

125,A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build,Switch,Draknek,"['Puzzle', 'Action']",E,"Sep  2, 2021","Polished budget puzzlers that come over from the mobile space are always a bit hard to judge critically and fairly when they arrive on Switch. In the case of Snowman there’s no doubt it’s a smart, well-designed, and challenging experience despite what, on the surface, would seem to be a simple premise. Yeah, you just need to get the torso on top of the base and get the head on top of that, but the trick is that every move needs to often be carefully planned, whether to just get each element in place or to use the snow on the ground to make one part bigger to be able to use it. The first very fair critique would be whether or not there’s anything about this being on the Switch, taking on the ability to play on your television and use physical controls, and the answer is not really… this would seem to work just fine without either option whether on your phone or a tablet. The second quibble concerns the overall difficulty, which kicks in pretty quickly. It isn’t impossible by any means, but there’s a risk of getting stuck and without any means for assistance that could be a bummer too. If you like a challenge, clean graphics, and a budget-friendly price it’s a good option, but it may just be more convenient on your mobile device in the end as well. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/09/mini-reviews-september-10th-edition.html",0,No score yet,1,1,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,2,0

Rather than being dominated with a sliding power gauge and then concerns like trying to get your hook or slice just right, the golf side of things is decidedly stripped down here. The focus, instead, being more on planning out your path to the hole, and perhaps taking up a special challenge along the way if you keep an eye out for opportunities. Of course, the fact that a bit of a clever narrative plays out as you progress just further adds flavor and just underlines the title’s distinctive charm. If you allow yourself to get bogged down by the lack of a traditional golfing feel, or perhaps the camera that isn’t always cooperative, it may lose some of its luster, but there’s no doubt this overall experience is the only one of its kind on the Switch… and that makes it worth a look. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/10/mini-reviews-october-19th-edition.html",80,Generally favorable reviews,8,3,0,tbd,No user score yet,2,1,0

328,Aegis Defenders,Switch,"Humble Bundle, GUTS Department","['Role-Playing', 'Action RPG']",E10+,"Feb  8, 2018","Aegis Defenders is a pretty good game that deserved to get a bit more attention than it did. In some ways it succeeds and in others it fails, but I would still recommend it to most people interested in Tower Defense/indie games with a good art style. The game is a mix between a TD and an action platformer, with 1 or 2 players controlling 2-4 characters (the number increases the farther you get into the game). Each character has specific structures that can be built (some of which require ingredients from 2 or more players), unique weapons, and a special ability. Every element can be upgraded. Personally, I challenged myself by finishing the game on 1P mode and insane difficulty without backtracking to previous levels. I suggest others do the same if they don't have a friend to play with. The game succeeds in being engaging, even if not always extremely fun. You quickly get thrown into this gameplay loop of challenge rewarded by extra story and your own choice of upgrades. In terms of story, the game is pretty good but not excellent, though it hits high notes from time to time. The characters are only decent. Outside of the story, the game has enough variance to where it hardly ever feels boring. Over time, certain structures start to be unlocked and some structures lose value as you generally have more resources available. At some point, I felt I had reason to use almost every structure, weapon, and character at least a few times. The flaws that this game does have are pretty huge. For one, there were a few minor glitches I encountered. Besides that, most levels have an exploratory phase before the tower defense phase. These are used for tutorials and puzzles (of which only a few are excellent), but hardly ever for platforming. Even the tower defense has more platforming because it requires you to collect and manage resources with a time limit. While juggling between characters to accomplish this is fun to some extent, the AI is too incompetent when you're not controlling a character. It's always rooted in once place and doesn't attack unless an enemy is very close, and when it does it's at a low firing rate. While the character combat is made more engaging by having to stay on your toes and adapt, fighting enemies usually means staying in one place and shooting. Some of the systems in place are easy to forget about. The game gives you a limited number of player hearts, but they are easily replenished so they're mostly easy to forget about. On occasion, I even forgot some of my characters had special abilities because I hardly used them. That being said, adapting around some of the game's flaws is much of what makes it so special. You have to see what works and what doesn't with your limitations and understand how to manage characters most efficiently. For example, it might be necessary to bring a character somewhere to repair buildings, another to work on a resource generator, another to stand by an enemy spawn where the enemies are of the same color so they take extra damage, and another to be controlled to extract resources. Then you can use one of the same characters as an anchor, using the ""follow"" command to bring the resource miner back more quickly. It's stressful at first, but once you get used to it it's all good, strategic fun with a huge level of depth and variety. Overall score: 7.5 out of 10",74,Mixed or average reviews,16,6,1,7.0,Mixed or average reviews,13,7,4

With only 30 seconds to finish each stage, though you do have the power to prolong your time limit if you collect enough gems, it definitely has an emphasis on execution. What’s a bit odd, though, is that there are absolutely things to the periphery, encouraging you to experiment with the paths you take, but I’m just not sure the need to explore and take chances is incentivized enough beyond the mere fact that you know things are there to collect. As you progress you’ll absolutely need to work out paths that are more efficient, typically involving some precision throws of your dagger that will allow you to teleport to it once it sticks in a surface, but once you survive aside from returning to shave off some seconds or try to collect things for giggles I’m don’t see a clear big picture incentive to expend the effort. It does make for a twitchy time, I just wish it had taken a step to take it one step further towards greatness. https://www.nindiespotlight.com/2021/10/mini-reviews-october-5th-edition.html",72,Mixed or average reviews,4,2,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,1,0

349,AeternoBlade II,Switch,Corecell Technology,"['Action', 'Platformer', '2D']",T,"Oct 11, 2019","Gameplay is a mix of action packed battles, metroidvania style exploration and puzzle solving, traversing a variety of environments, battling monsters and bosses as you seek to save the universe from destruction, switching between the three characters at various points in the story, moving back and forth between the different locations to open up new paths, solve previous puzzles and find hidden treasures.The game uses a mix of side scrolling and over the shoulder camera perspectives, the majority of gameplay takes place in the side scrolling view, with boss battles and large scale battles using the third person camera, there is also quick time events scattered throughout various parts of the story. When the player enters a room they may be “locked in”, this is where they are will face waves of enemies that will attack the player, once all enemies have been defeated the player may then progress.The combat system utilizes a mixture of three types attack, a special skill, powerful time bending abilities and a mechanic called flash, a dash skill that allows the player to avoid attacks with each use having to cool down. Each of the three characters can upgrade their skills using orbs collected from defeated enemies, completing missions and as rewards, the orbs can also be used to purchase items in the shop, unlock relics and level up character stats.Speaking of items and relics, the items that the player can use include potions, temporary boosts and exploration aids, the relics offer stat boosts that can be set into custom loadouts for each player, the stat boosts can be used to either increase a characters strengths or offset a characters weaknesses, this gives an additional level of depth to the way the player can customize their experience to fit their own play style.Since the game uses a metroidvania approach to the progression of the story there are points throughout the world where the player can save, manage relics, items, teleport and take on special challenges using the time shifting skills. Now with the details of gameplay out of the way it is time to talk about the downsides of AeternoBlade II.The 3D movement is a whole other issue, the camera seems to fight against the player while trying to control it, moving while trying to avoid attacks can obscure the players view, this is most prevalent during large scale battles against several enemies and boss battles, the camera can go out of bounds when too close to a wall which is a nuisance, one upside to the over the shoulder camera is the ability to lock onto the enemies, offsetting some of the camera difficulties.Controls for combat and movement are solid, with fluidity to them as the battles go on, there is a very little input lag when executing combo attacks and using the various skills, there can be some trouble during boss fights however as there is slowdown while playing in handheld mode, this is something that the developers are working on so hopefully it will be fixed in the near future.Visually AeternoBlade II is aesthetically pleasing, while not at the same resolution as the PS4 version the game still looks good on Nintendo Switch, the overall look is a mix between fantasy and anime, for an indie title it is very well polished, the environments have a lot of grandeur to them, the monsters and cast of characters are expertly animated, having a natural look to movement and are well designed with a lot of personality to them.The sound is a mixed bag, the soundtrack is done well with suspenseful atmospheric string based compositions, fantasy styled orchestral pieces and an opening piano theme with soft vocals layered over it. The sound effects used are effective with the clashing of blades having a nice impact during combat, voice acting is difficult to judge, again, being an independent release the quality of voice cast isn’t what you would expect from a big budget title but I feel it has its own charm to it.Overall, I enjoyed my time playing AeternoBlade II, there are flaws with the game but they aren’t significant enough for me to say the game isn’t worth playing, the camera issues take a little getting used to and will hopefully be addressed with an upcoming patch, the difficulty curve did have a level of frustration to it, but it wasn’t impossible and the lack of feedback through vibration/collision detection flaws did pull me out of the experience but I don’t see it as a deal breaker.",44,Generally unfavorable reviews,0,3,4,4.2,Generally unfavorable reviews,7,1,10

Será capaz de introducirnos por completo en su historia. No sólo nos ofrecerá la posibilidad de formar parte de ella, sino que nos dejará pensando en qué ocurrirá incluso al apagar la consola. A través de una sencillez gráfica y de controles, se crea una adictiva, emocionante y sorprendente aventura adulta. Cuenta con detalles brillantes en dos dimensiones, muy bien dibujados, y con personajes a los que será muy sencillo cogerles cariño. Sus continuos homenajes y la capacidad para ofrecer el mejor humor la convierten en una propuesta que roza la perfección. No faltan las críticas hacia temas controvertidos, expresadas de una manera directa, efectiva y divertida. Su final sobrecogedor será el resultado de una reflexión sobre la religión, la calidad de los productos, la moralidad y el consumo de animales, cuestiones actuales que deberían tener un mayor peso en la cultura. Estemos a favor o en contra, no estará de más ver el mundo desde los ojos de una niña un tanto excéntrica. Los puzles sencillos dejan todo el protagonismo a su historia. Aunque es gratificante resolverlos, la mayor diversión llegará al ir descubriendo nuevos datos de sus personajes y al crear la religión. Es más que justo, ya que no es habitual encontrar argumentos tan originales en un sector donde ya está todo creado. Dispuesto a hacer las delicias de principiantes y veteranos en el género, ofrece un sistema de ayuda de la mano del propio Sandro. Este personaje, clave en la aventura, no sólo nos ofrecerá un desplazamiento más rápido, sino que nos otorgará las pistas necesarias en caso de atascarnos. En definitiva, Agatha Knife podría estar dentro de un listado de juegos que hay que probar, al menos, una vez en la vida. Nos llevará a conocer el llamado ‘Universo Psychotic’ de Mango Protocol y a querer saber más sobre la historia de Nika, contada en el primer juego. Completarlo nos llevará únicamente un par de tardes, gracias en parte a esos puzles poco enrevesados y a los cortos tiempos de carga (marcados con los semáforos de las calles). Sin embargo, como ya hemos comentado, quedará guardado en la memoria para siempre. Se crea, así, una correcta relación calidad-precio. Como elementos negativos, quizás su jugabilidad lineal no convenza a todo el mundo.

I have played through the story mode with 2 of the 4 different mages and have played for about 4-5 hours with a another player on my console plugged into a tv. Here is what this game is to its core its a game about mages where you venture through different levels, some with bosses some without bosses there is 4 playable mage classes with them having a unique skill tree, and spells. As you might have wondered about couch co-op yes there is couch co op! You can have up to 4 players at the same time! With the level design stripped down it's fairly nothing more than a straight line or some bends in a path or road. There are unique monsters, different weapons, health items that drop, mana potions to restore mana, and gold/gems. There are different shops that unlock as you progress offering a upgrade in weapons. There are also different difficulty levels that you can play on. Newbie level does not reward players with achievements but if you are looking to just wreck havoc as a mage for fun or had a long day and need to unwind and kill monsters it's still fun and some monsters in later stages can be a challenge sometimes. I have tried varying challenge levels for at least the first 7 stages and if you are a gamer who enjoys being tested to the limits you will be able to be tested on the highest challenge level. The combat is pretty simple you have 2 spells to start out with and you can upgrade them into higher skill levels for example Lighting 1 - lightning 1-2 - lightning 2 the game in my opinion is a better version of Nine Parchments.

It looks and runs terribly, which makes navigating the confusing mazelike areas a bit frustrating. The puzzles, skill tree (which I didn’t touch upon but makes almost no difference to how the game plays), and demon possession all feel rather underwhelmingly undercooked. Despite all this, there was something there that hooked me. After the awful opening section of the game, I found myself intrigued as to what was around the next corner and how the game would progress. Underneath all its faults, there’s actually some solid ideas and aesthetic design that could have been made into something good. Should you pay €19.99 for it? No. Should you pay €1.99 for it? Probably not,… but if you’re willing to see it through, it may not end up being a complete waste of time – especially if you dive into the genuinely enjoyable Succubus Mode. It is worth noting however that the PC version of Agony Unrated looks a lot better than the Switch version, so if you are tempted then perhaps that could be an alternative option.

More proof that quality does not only come from AAA games, but from talented developers with a passion project.",74,Mixed or average reviews,7,5,0,7.4,Mixed or average reviews,17,4,5

415,Aleste Collection,Switch,M2,"['Miscellaneous', 'Compilation']",,"Dec 24, 2020","I bought the collection - not least because of the extremely positive feedback from the press. After trying out the thoroughly aged games for a while, I was disappointed beyond measure. Especially the first title, Aleste 1, is actually unenjoyable without the solidly implemented comfort features. The game is very simplistic and unfairly difficult. The gameplay is also nothing special, even though reviewers often try to construct a historical relevance here that I don't see in any way. Darius (1987), for example, is even older and has aged much better.The remaining titles play better, but are still inferior in quality to other early genre representatives in my opinion. The solid restoration as well as the functional enhancements are template-like, but still well done. After all, this is where the developer studio M2 has distinguished itself over the years. Nevertheless, even the updates don't save the overall package.The 2020 GG Aleste 3 is admittedly conceptually interesting as a postmodern pastiche. The game is ultimately symptomatic of an infatuation with the aesthetics and gameplay experience of the past, but to put it polemically on the level of a mobile game from the late 2000s. KAll in all, I strongly advise against buying it. For those who consider such releases as collector's items, be my guest, for any ""rational"" buyer the price is almost a cheek.P.S.:The 8-bit soundtrack was still cool (even if that's not a reason to buy).",0,No score yet,1,0,0,tbd,No user score yet,0,0,1
